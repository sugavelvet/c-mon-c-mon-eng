1
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,702
<i>Okay, I'm gonna
ask you a series of questions,</i>

2
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:13,740
<i>and there are no right or wrong answers.</i>

3
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:17,944
<i>So when you think about the future,</i>

4
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:20,312
<i>how do you imagine it'll be?</i>

5
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:22,815
<i>Like, what will nature be like?</i>

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,651
How will your city change?

7
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,655
Will families be the same?

8
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:37,029
What will stay with you,
and what will you forget?

9
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,067
What scares you?

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,935
What makes you angry?

11
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,369
Do you feel lonely?

12
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,007
What makes you happy?

13
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,450
<i>So we are goin' around the country,</i>

14
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:01,586
goin' to different cities
and interviewing kids,

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,757
ranging in age, um,
just about their... their life

16
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,626
<i>and what they think about the future.</i>

17
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,662
<i>If I ask you anything
that you don't wanna answer,</i>

18
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,078
or you don't like a question or whatever,

19
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:13,800
you can just be like, "No."

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,114
I want you to just feel comfortable,

21
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:17,069
and if there's anything
that I ask you about

22
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,070
that you don't wanna talk about,

23
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:19,972
say "I don't really wanna talk about that."

24
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,975
I think adults always think
they're the boss,

25
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,477
and they always gotta
be the boss of everything.

26
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,747
And I think that some adults
have that mindset

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,128
where "I'm right and you're wrong."

28
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,883
When you think about the future,

29
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,684
how do you imagine it'll be?

30
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,686
I...

31
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,757
I imagine and hope it'll be good.

32
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:40,827
<i>And do you ever think,</i>

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,108
<i>like, what could adults have done</i>

34
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:45,630
<i>to have made sure that
we went in the right path?</i>

35
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,566
Definitely most of all, paid more attention

36
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,668
to, like, what's going on around them,

37
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,603
'cause I feel like that's a big problem

38
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:53,840
with, like, literally everything.

39
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:55,808
Like, that's a big, big thing.

40
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:58,758
<i>They'll be like, "Oh, you're from Detroit."</i>

41
00:01:58,778 --> 00:01:59,779
<i>I was like, "Yeah."</i>

42
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:00,780
<i>Like, "It's really dangerous there.</i>

43
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:02,949
<i>"The schools are really terrible</i>

44
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:05,051
<i>"and, like, nothing's good there."</i>

45
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,651
I was like, "Well, how would you know?

46
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:07,719
"You don't live there,

47
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,801
"and you don't go to school there.

48
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,122
"You weren't raised in Detroit.

49
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:13,125
"Like, I've been raised
in Detroit all my life."

50
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,427
<i>America, uh, it's so much...</i>

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,996
<i>It's so much tragedy,</i>

52
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,965
<i>and some people aren't treated fairly,</i>

53
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,767
because of race, because of who they like,

54
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,602
because of where they live,

55
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,503
because of how much money they have.

56
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:27,740
So I would want it to become a better place

57
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,875
<i>and people to know</i>

58
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:29,876
<i>that just because someone isn't like you</i>

59
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,744
<i>doesn't mean that they're wrong,</i>

60
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,411
<i>but then I'm not sure.</i>

61
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,646
<i>We're at the point right now</i>

62
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,949
where we have to change things,

63
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,952
and just based on our morals as people,

64
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,454
I don't really see
that happening anytime soon.

65
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,926
<i>So, you're...
You're hopeful for the future?</i>

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,007
<i>Like, when you think about the future,</i>

67
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:50,763
<i>you think it'll be better or worse?</i>

68
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,898
<i>For me, personally,</i>

69
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,933
<i>I feel like things are gonna get better,</i>

70
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,569
<i>because I have a lot
of opportunities right now.</i>

71
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:58,804
<i>I'm hopeful for myself,</i>

72
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:00,206
<i>for other people.</i>

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,507
<i>I don't know if things
are gonna get better,</i>

74
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,575
<i>it's really on the side,</i>

75
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,048
<i>but I really hope things get better.</i>

76
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:09,481
<i>Um, but for the overall world,</i>

77
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,018
<i>once again I hope it gets better,</i>

78
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:15,121
<i>but it might not, like everything.</i>

79
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,957
<i>If you could have one superpower,</i>

80
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,225
<i>what would it be?</i>

81
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,293
<i>That's a hard question.</i>

82
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,662
<i>Um, that's one of the popular questions</i>

83
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:25,097
<i>that I ask people.</i>

84
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,531
<i>Some people say...</i>

85
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,634
Detroit was the future.

86
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,575
So we came to...

87
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:42,949
We came to Detroit
to talk to young people, kids.

88
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:47,119
You know, we came to Detroit
to talk to kids, young people,

89
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:51,157
and to ask them

90
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,092
what they thought
their lives would be like,

91
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,963
how it's changing for them,

92
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,799
what are they inspired by and excited by,

93
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,734
and what are their lives like now?

94
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,853
<i>Hey.</i>

95
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:21,954
Hey.

96
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,056
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

97
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,760
It's nice that you called.

98
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,930
I didn't know if I was gonna call

99
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,798
or if you would...

100
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:34,532
If no one would...

101
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,504
It's a good day to talk.

102
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,608
Maybe Mom's listening.

103
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,644
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

104
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,850
<i>It doesn't feel
like it's been a year to me.</i>

105
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:53,185
<i>Does it to you?</i>

106
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,956
<i>No, it's weird.</i>

107
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,861
I didn't know what to do with myself today.

108
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:06,899
<i>Yeah, I know. If I just, um, work,</i>

109
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>then I feel like I'm not mourning</i>

110
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,102
<i>in the right way or whatever.</i>

111
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:15,975
<i>And if I sit in this depressing hotel room</i>

112
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:17,743
<i>and just think about Mom,</i>

113
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,179
then, yeah, it's just pretty brutal.

114
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,015
So, yeah, I called you.

115
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,287
Where are you?

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,356
Um, I'm in Detroit.

117
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,726
I've been, um, interviewing kids.

118
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:35,995
Uh, so that was cool.

119
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:37,196
- <i>Cool.</i>
- Yeah.

120
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,631
<i>Jesse heard you on the radio the other day.</i>

121
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:40,698
Oh, yeah?

122
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,168
<i>Yeah, we were driving,</i>

123
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,071
<i>and there you were on the radio as usual,</i>

124
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:47,740
<i>and I had to tell him it was you.</i>

125
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,210
- <i>Really?</i>
- He's nine, you know?

126
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,324
He didn't recognize your voice,

127
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:53,379
it's been a year.

128
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:55,114
It's a long time for a kid.

129
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,617
Wow.

130
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,053
All right.

131
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,088
<i>Yeah.</i>

132
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,857
<i>How's Jesse?</i>

133
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,759
<i>Uh, he's so good.</i>

134
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:10,996
<i>He's smart, and he's so weird.</i>

135
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,900
He's older, and he's funny,
and I don't know, he's...

136
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,736
He's... he's a whole little person.

137
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:21,774
Um, and Paul moved to Oakland.

138
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:23,843
<i>He did?</i>

139
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,144
Yeah.

140
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,711
Whoa, really?

141
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,014
<i>Yeah, it's okay.</i>

142
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,850
<i>I... It's... I think so.</i>

143
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:33,319
<i>Jesse is dealing with it well so far,</i>

144
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,287
<i>but Paul's not.</i>

145
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:36,755
- <i>He is...</i>
- Hmm.

146
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,924
<i>I mean, he... I'm just...</i>

147
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:40,392
<i>He's fine.</i>

148
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,261
<i>I just have to go up and help a little.</i>

149
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:43,929
<i>Help him settle in.</i>

150
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:45,831
Oh, yeah?

151
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,933
<i>Yeah.</i>

152
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:50,903
<i>So I'm heading up there soon,
but we're good.</i>

153
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:56,775
So you taking... You taking Jesse?

154
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:57,943
<i>No.</i>

155
00:06:57,977 --> 00:07:00,379
<i>No, I don't think it's that kind of trip.</i>

156
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,850
So who's watching Jesse?

157
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,922
<i>I haven't gotten there yet.</i>

158
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

159
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:08,414
Hi.

160
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,448
Hey.

161
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:13,319
Say hi.

162
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,187
"Hi, how are you?"

163
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,388
How are you?

164
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:17,890
I'm good. How are you?

165
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:19,892
I'm good.

166
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,493
Hmm.

167
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,929
Wanna ask Uncle Johnny to come in?

168
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,931
You should ask me if I wanna come in.

169
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,099
Do you wanna come in?

170
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,133
- Thank you.
- Okay.

171
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,369
I get a hug?

172
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:50,389
We have, um, her dresses

174
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:53,425
um, all my homework stuff.

175
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,962
Hmm, cool.

176
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:59,031
Mom says you're gonna sleep up here tonight

177
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:04,303
in her extra-big, cozy bed,
best bed in the house.

178
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:08,340
So there are these, um, big, big, big, big,

179
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:13,279
big, um, little like fungus tubes

180
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:16,081
or tubes that are fungus,

181
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:18,484
and they're connecting all the trees.

182
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,152
- so they're up here.
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,288
And they'd be really tall.

184
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,556
They get all the food, and then you kinda,

185
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,060
like, go through the tubes
into another tree.

186
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,297
And then, um, well, they...

187
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,998
They would, like, get all the food

188
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,099
and then it'll go through.

189
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,868
And so the tree needs...

190
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,616
So what's goin' on
with Paul? How's he doin'?

191
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:38,837
Oh, I don't know.

192
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,307
I mean, he was offered this,
you know, incredible position

193
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,841
at the San Francisco Symphony,

194
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,209
which he totally deserves,

195
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:46,445
but the transition fucked him up.

196
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,547
- Mm-hmm.
- Like transitions always do.

197
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,983
And... And then he got a fucking dog,

198
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,152
which he should not have gotten, so...

199
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:55,220
- No. No.
- So, yeah. It's just...

200
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:58,824
It's... It's... It's a total mess as usual.

201
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,460
And you have to clean it up?

202
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:02,928
Yeah.

203
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,863
Yeah, that's Paul.

204
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:08,467
What about Jesse? What does he know?

205
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,870
Nothing. I said I was gonna
help him get organized,

206
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,539
so we'll go together later.

207
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,942
He gonna be okay just with me?

208
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:18,310
Like, what...

209
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:20,079
He loves it when I'm not around.

210
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,181
He'll have so much fun.

211
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,248
Yeah?

212
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,453
It's really good to see you.

213
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:29,621
Hello?

214
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,325
Is anyone home?

215
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:39,498
- Hello?
- Uh, are you ready for this?

216
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,434
God, what?

217
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,436
- Hello?
- Brace yourself.

218
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,538
There's this, uh, little orphan

219
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:47,439
who likes to come visit me.

220
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:50,442
In fact, he will probably come visit you,

221
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:55,047
and he likes to pretend that,
uh, I have some dead children,

222
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,183
and he asks me a lot of
questions about what they did,

223
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,552
so he can do those same things.

224
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,654
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:07,459
It's really... It's totally normal.

226
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,027
All the kids do this.

227
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,964
Is anyone home?

228
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:13,265
I'm coming.

229
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,306
- Hi.
- Hi.

230
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,474
Is this the orphan?

231
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:24,376
Mm-hmm.

232
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,011
Can I sleep here tonight?

233
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,626
They only have bunk beds at the orphanage

234
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,082
and all the kids snore.

235
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:33,185
Hmm, of course you can.

236
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:36,488
Uh, actually, my son's
not here tonight, so...

237
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:43,028
I could take his place if you want.

238
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,330
That's a good idea.

239
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,965
He usually goes to bed right now.

240
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:51,738
You know, this way, I happen to have a room

241
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,339
with a bed just your size.

242
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,474
You wanna check it out?

243
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,244
"Dorothy lived in the midst

244
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:00,612
"of the great Kansas prairies

245
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,549
"with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer,

246
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:06,051
"and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife."

247
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,124
<i>She hugged me, and she felt different,</i>

248
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:14,693
<i>or I felt different,</i>

249
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:18,363
<i>and, yeah, Jesse maybe
vaguely remembered me.</i>

250
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,500
<i>Maybe. Maybe not.</i>

251
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,535
Da, da. Da, da, da, da.

252
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:31,543
He told me about trees
communicating with each other

253
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:34,246
<i>and how connected they were</i>

254
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,616
<i>by an underground network of fungus.</i>

255
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,249
Love you, love you, love you,
love you, love you.

256
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:58,303
Mmm.

257
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:59,806
Love you, love you, love you.

258
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,711
Oh, cozy. Okay, go back to sleep.

259
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:23,662
Good morning.

260
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:26,532
It's loud!

261
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,700
It's Saturday.

262
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,537
I get to be loud on Saturdays.

263
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:39,012
- Mom just left?
- Uh-huh.

264
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:42,381
She said you might be a bit awkward.

265
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:43,248
What?

266
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,418
She said you might be a bit awkward.

267
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,521
But you'll get used to things.

268
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,158
Will you turn it down a little?

269
00:13:56,128 --> 00:14:00,132
She left you some notes in the kitchen.

270
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:14,546
Is that a microphone

271
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,448
or is it a... in the headphones?

272
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,449
Huh?

273
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,752
Is it... Is the mic
in the headphones and...

274
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:21,353
Or is that the mic?

275
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:22,822
This is the mic,

276
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:25,190
and I'm just gonna
get a quick little level.

277
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,224
Careful.

278
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:28,861
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

279
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:33,432
So when you think about the future,

280
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:35,567
what do you imagine?

281
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:39,404
Um, I don't wan... I don't wanna.

282
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,909
You don't wanna imagine
what the future's like?

283
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:45,177
I don't wanna do the questions.

284
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:48,480
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, what's that?

285
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,415
- Um...
- There's a screw there,

286
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,731
and there's loads of little buttons.

287
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:53,652
Well, that's the... That's the gain.

288
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,519
The gain?

289
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,555
Well, it's how you know how much...

290
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,723
Here, put these on.

291
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,429
Do you see this?

292
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:05,464
Here.

293
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:12,337
- Can you hear that?
- I can...

294
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,438
- Yes.
- ...hear that.

295
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:16,909
Yeah. So this is what you
adjust for an input volume.

296
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,745
<i>Now it's super quiet.</i>

297
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:19,912
<i>So turn it all the way up,</i>

298
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,213
<i>you can feel that.</i>

299
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:44,937
Having fun?

300
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,806
It all sounds amazing in here.

301
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,208
My dad would love this.

302
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:54,646
Johnny!

303
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,848
You need something?

304
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,352
My mom tells me stories.

305
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:02,521
It can be fiction or non-fiction.

306
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh, boy, I don't know any stories.

307
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:09,394
Um...

308
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:14,533
Can we just talk
and get to know each other?

309
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,636
Why did she stop talkin' to you?

310
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,842
Um, we talk.

311
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,509
No, you don't.

312
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,350
I mean, I don't know.

313
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:33,953
Did you used to talk a lot?

314
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,591
Yeah.

315
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:47,800
Johnny, where have you been?

316
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,403
- Hi.
- You can help me.

317
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:52,504
Yeah, what do you need?

318
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:53,840
He's coming to get me.

319
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,641
Who's coming?

320
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:58,477
I have to get dressed.

321
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:03,448
My dad's taking me to the DMV.

322
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,284
My sweater was over there.

323
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,954
Help me up.

324
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,824
I'm gonna get my license.

325
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,358
<i>I don't know why you give in</i>

326
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:14,794
to those delusions like that.

327
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:15,862
Are you serious?

328
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:16,963
Yeah, I'm serious.

329
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:18,831
Are you fucking serious?

330
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:19,866
<i>Easy, I got you.</i>

331
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,469
Hurry.

332
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,605
Why wouldn't I entertain it?

333
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:28,573
Just let her have that. Why you...

334
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,442
What's going on?

335
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:32,611
My dad's coming to get me.

336
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,046
Mom, why don't you, um...

337
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,648
Why don't we wait for your dad lying down?

338
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,716
You just give in to her!

339
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,650
You always just give in to her!

340
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,932
- This is precisely...
- Whatever she wants!

341
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,033
...what you should give in to.

342
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,021
- What are you talking about?
- It's not her, though.

343
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,422
It's not even her...

344
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:45,423
<i>What is your problem?</i>

345
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:46,358
<i>You know what my problem is?</i>

346
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:47,292
- <i>Yeah, yeah.
- It's that</i>

347
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,427
for our entire lives, I am the only one

348
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:50,930
whoever challenged them.

349
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,111
Really? Really? For our entire lives?

350
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:54,066
<i>Yes. Yes, really.</i>

351
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,968
<i>So easy for you.</i>

352
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,649
They made me feel like I was a crazy person

353
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:58,703
again and again,

354
00:17:58,738 --> 00:18:00,605
and you just went along with it.

355
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:03,408
<i>You don't exactly make it easy to help you.</i>

356
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:07,880
<i>Well, maybe, but I needed your help.</i>

357
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:13,019
Look, you're losing a mom who adored you.

358
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:14,719
She just did.

359
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:18,423
And I'm losing one who never understood me.

360
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:35,640
Okay, Mom.

361
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:36,708
<i>"'It is kind of you</i>

362
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:37,822
<i>"'to wear that, ' said Boq.</i>

363
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:39,745
<i>"'Blue is the color of the Munchkins,</i>

364
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,814
"'and white is the witch color.

365
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:44,482
"'So we know you are a friendly witch.'

366
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,484
"Dorothy didn't know what to say.

367
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:48,988
"Dorothy did not know what to say to this,

368
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:51,057
"for all the people seemed
to think her a witch,

369
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,850
- "and she knew..."
- Why aren't you married?

370
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,430
Um, I was with...

371
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:01,133
I was with somebody
for a long time, Louisa.

372
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,667
"And she knew very well

373
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,770
"she was only an ordinary little girl

374
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,973
"who had come by the chance of a cyclone

375
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,726
- "into a strange land."
- Did you love her?

376
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:11,710
I still do.

377
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,747
Then why did you break up?

378
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:21,486
I don't know.

379
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:28,460
Um... "When she had tired
watching the dancing,

380
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,463
"Boq... Boq led her into the house,

381
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,698
"where he gave her a room
with a pretty bed in it."

382
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,700
I don't think it was my choice.

383
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:38,738
Mm, I think, um,

384
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,909
you love each other,

385
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:46,544
and then you still love each other,

386
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:51,516
but find it hard to express
that love to each other,

387
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,220
and so then you look at each other,

388
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,620
and you do this.

389
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,524
And you go, "Oh."

390
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,162
You... You know, I mean,

391
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:04,243
I hope you don't have the experience,

392
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,032
but you probably will.

393
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:07,800
It's all right, actually.

394
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,938
Um, "The sh..."

395
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,139
"Pretty bed in it.

396
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,807
"The sheets were made of blue cloth,

397
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,142
"and Dorothy slept soundly..."

398
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,810
Okay, good night.

399
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,178
Um, so what happened...

400
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,515
<i>Read him</i> The Wizard of Oz,

401
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:24,683
<i>kissed him on the head,</i>

402
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:27,119
and said good night,

403
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:31,090
and he asked me why am I not married.

404
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:36,095
I didn't tell him that I wanna be,

405
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,165
that I miss Louisa.

406
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,202
I made it into a weird joke.

407
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:48,140
<i>Why'd I do that?</i>

408
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:05,157
<i>Not so long ago,</i>

409
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:07,927
<i>in an Arctic village far away,</i>

410
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,595
<i>there lived a polar bear family.</i>

411
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:14,266
<i>There was a papa polar bear,
a mama polar bear,</i>

412
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,102
<i>and a baby polar bear,</i>

413
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:18,938
<i>and they all loved each other very much,</i>

414
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:21,107
<i>but something was not quite right.</i>

415
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:25,044
<i>Baby bear knew something was wrong.</i>

416
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:29,181
<i>He never said a word,
but he worried all the time.</i>

417
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:31,083
<i>He worried about his papa.</i>

418
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,320
<i>You see, Papa Bear had a hard time</i>

419
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:36,122
<i>controlling his feelings</i>

420
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:39,191
<i>and sometimes he did things that upset,</i>

421
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,327
<i>and even scared Mama and Baby Bear.</i>

422
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,773
So should I call you like "Papa"

423
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:55,307
or "Dad" or just "Johnny"?

424
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:58,676
You can call me

425
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,712
whatever feels comfortable to you.

426
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:02,580
Uh, I... I don't know,

427
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,454
it's just I'm not used
to being able to choose.

428
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:09,587
Maybe we can just take this process slowly

429
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:14,592
and... And see... See how it feels.

430
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,595
Mm-hmm, yeah.

431
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:23,169
And I'm just really sorry
that your children died.

432
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:28,074
Um, you know, I don't think
I can do that part.

433
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:31,143
Yeah, I... I told you
that's how me and Mom do it.

434
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:34,113
If it's... makes sense
for your mom to do that,

435
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,294
that's cool, but it doesn't
make sense for me

436
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,248
and that's what I was explaining to you.

437
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:37,897
Why it doesn't make sense for you? It's...

438
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:38,984
Because it's ridiculous.

439
00:22:39,018 --> 00:22:41,287
- Is it...
- It's sad.

440
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,191
The question is why do you wanna do it.

441
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:48,260
You are just terrible at this.

442
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:49,895
Oh, man, I'm tryin'.

443
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,664
Let... Let me ask you a question.

444
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:57,203
Why does everything have to be
like this kind of weird,

445
00:22:57,236 --> 00:23:00,106
- eccentric thing that you do?
- 'Cause I like it.

446
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:01,240
Yeah, but why not just

447
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:02,942
- do something normal?
- What's normal?

448
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:04,323
Like everything in your real life...

449
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:06,011
What's normal?

450
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:07,913
Okay, fine. Good point.

451
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:10,182
<i>The only thing that I do have</i>

452
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:11,951
<i>is that I know what I'm saying.</i>

453
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:14,053
{\an8}<i>I'm in a home where people care about me</i>

454
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:16,956
{\an8}<i>and I have friends
that care about me and...</i>

455
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,806
<i>That's the total randomness.</i>

456
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,706
Like there was nothing.

457
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,222
It was like a triangle one on this one

458
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:37,176
and a square on this one,

459
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,911
and half of the block would be a triangle,

460
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:39,845
and the other half would be a word,

461
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:41,460
and they'll be like,
"Can you figure it out?"

462
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,095
It looked very similar to this floor here.

463
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:44,016
<i>Hi.</i>

464
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,318
<i>Hey, what's... what's going on?</i>

465
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:48,754
<i>Oh, it's really bad.</i>

466
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:52,825
He really needs to go somewhere for help

467
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:56,962
<i>and he's not letting me, uh, get him there.</i>

468
00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:58,297
I'm sleeping, I'm going to work,

469
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,378
- I have...
- Are you sleeping?

470
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,432
I am sleeping!

471
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,268
How many hours do you usually...

472
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:04,303
Does that matter?

473
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:06,172
I'm sleeping, I'm sleeping!

474
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:08,340
<i>You know, he's totally fucking paranoid.</i>

475
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:09,742
<i>Just the second I bring it up...</i>

476
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:12,011
<i>Yeah, you know, I just tried
to put some things in a bag</i>

477
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:14,079
<i>and he totally fucking lost his mind.</i>

478
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:15,161
And you took all these clothes

479
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:15,981
if I'm gonna be there
for a month or two months

480
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:17,396
- or whatever.
- No, no, no, we don't...

481
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:18,464
we don't have to. No, no, no.

482
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:19,765
Because I want all my things there.

483
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:20,586
<i>I know that I can
get him to check himself in,</i>

484
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,355
but I've just... I've gotta lay off

485
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:25,491
and just slow down.

486
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:28,961
So can you stay with Jesse for me

487
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:30,229
for another couple of days?

488
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,998
<i>I called Jesse's school
and put you on the list,</i>

489
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,480
<i>and you can... You can
just bring him to school</i>

490
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,035
<i>and pick him up.</i>

491
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:37,136
<i>Can you do that?</i>

492
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:39,371
Yeah, I can.

493
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:40,472
Um...

494
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:41,740
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

495
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:42,841
But, uh, Viv, you know,

496
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,244
I'm supposed to do these,
um, interviews on Friday

497
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:49,114
<i>back in New York,
um, but I'll figure it out.</i>

498
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:51,083
You will? You can... You can do that?

499
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:52,918
<i>Yeah, don't... I'll figure somethin' out.</i>

500
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,019
Okay.

501
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:56,956
Thank you.

502
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:59,158
Thank you.

503
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:02,428
<i>And listen, you just don't say
anything to him, okay?</i>

504
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,929
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

505
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:20,179
<i>I think our first one</i>

506
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:23,082
<i>is maybe 9:00 on Saturday.
Will you be back for that?</i>

507
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:24,283
Yeah, definitely.

508
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,485
<i>Cool.</i>

509
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:30,389
<i>Is that something where
I'll see you before that</i>

510
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:33,559
<i>or should I send you
the pre-interview notes</i>

511
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:36,028
<i>Fernando gave us for like the plane?</i>

512
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:38,998
Um... Yeah, I'll be there,

513
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:40,432
but, um, yeah, just send it,

514
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:43,302
just... just so I have it
and I'll look at it,

515
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:47,940
but, no, I'll be in, um, Friday.

516
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,355
Well, I don't know, I haven't
figured out a ticket yet,

517
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,542
- but, um...
- <i>Okay.</i>

518
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:52,177
I'll figure somethin' out.

519
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,913
<i>And how's... How's like Vivs and stuff?</i>

520
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:57,483
Good.

521
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,485
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Good. Yeah.

522
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,454
Yeah, it's, um, I mean, you know,

523
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:04,523
we're just working out,

524
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:07,426
but, um, this kid is fucking great.

525
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,560
<i>Yeah?</i>

526
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,095
He's got...

527
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,543
He's got the gear on and he's, uh...

528
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:15,434
<i>Oh, have you been showing him
like audio recording stuff?</i>

529
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,002
Have you been to New York?

530
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:19,605
No.

531
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:21,540
Never been to New York?

532
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:24,009
Never ever been to New York.

533
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:28,414
You don't think all the,
like, sunshine and sand,

534
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:32,351
and bodies is kinda boring?

535
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,255
No.

536
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:38,357
Oh, man.

537
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:41,994
You know, you should come with me.

538
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:45,197
What?

539
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,532
Yeah, come with me to New York.

540
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,969
Like... Like, right now?

541
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,571
Well, not right now, but, yeah,

542
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:53,639
I have to go this weekend

543
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:56,542
to do interviews and stuff,
and you can help me.

544
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:02,014
You know, record sound

545
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:03,449
and maybe I can,

546
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:04,917
like, weave that into the show.

547
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,218
I think it'd be fun.

548
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,454
I'd love that.

549
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:40,652
Hi!

550
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,454
Come here.

551
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,158
Paul?

552
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:49,694
Paul?

553
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:54,133
<i>Uh, so Paul is gone.</i>

554
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,134
Paul?

555
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,336
<i>Uh, he doesn't answer his phone,</i>

556
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,417
<i>I don't know where he went.</i>

557
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:00,339
Uh, does he even want help?

558
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:01,306
I feel like he just...

559
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,342
He just wants you back taking care of him.

560
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,544
Oh, God. Oh, please, don't... Don't start.

561
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,613
I can't do this with you right now.

562
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,695
Just hear me out for a second.
I know you're stressed out,

563
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:11,283
but just hear me out for a second.

564
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,653
What if Jesse came with me to New York?

565
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,556
He said that he wanted to
and I think that, um...

566
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,057
<i>What do mean, he said he wanted to?</i>

567
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:20,325
<i>You already asked him?</i>

568
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,541
<i>No, we talked about New York...</i>

569
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:23,495
Oh, God, you already asked him.

570
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:24,963
<i>And he said he'd never been there.</i>

571
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:25,931
<i>Calm down.</i>

572
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:27,146
Johnny, you don't ask a nine-year-old kid

573
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,169
if they want go to New York
before you ask their mother!

574
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:32,104
Viv, I wanna help, I wanna help.

575
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:33,372
- <i>Jesus Christ!</i>
- Listen to me.

576
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:35,587
I'm tryin' to help you and
this is a way that I can help.

577
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:37,443
Well, that's not helpful.

578
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,077
Uh...

579
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,613
I'll call somebody else.

580
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:43,081
I'll figure it out.

581
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:47,653
<i>And I sat on the wall</i>

582
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,289
<i>waiting for him to come out of school,</i>

583
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:53,459
<i>and then I heard all the kids
coming out of school,</i>

584
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:56,729
<i>running down the steps, talking loud,</i>

585
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:58,597
<i>and then he came down.</i>

586
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,067
And then, this stupid little voice

587
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,772
with this cute
little fucking hair and face,

588
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:09,041
he was like, "Did you talk to Mom?"

589
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:10,175
<i>I said, "Yeah."</i>

590
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,244
<i>"Well, what did she say?"</i>

591
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:14,613
<i>"She loves you very much."</i>

592
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:18,083
<i>'Cause I couldn't tell him.</i>

593
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:28,026
<i>Hey.</i>

594
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,496
So listen, can you find
somebody in New York

595
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:31,643
to watch him when you're working?

596
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,266
Is that a realistic plan
that you could make happen?

597
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:35,634
Yes.

598
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,169
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yes.

599
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:38,403
<i>Who would that person be?</i>

600
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,107
I'll find someone.

601
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,509
I'll figure it out, I promise.

602
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:47,713
Okay. Okay.

603
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:49,348
<i>I called Jesse's teacher,</i>

604
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,116
<i>and said there's a family emergency,</i>

605
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:52,618
<i>and I'll be out for about a week.</i>

606
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:54,253
<i>I'll send you his assignments.</i>

607
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:55,654
Don't worry.

608
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,762
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

609
00:30:02,795 --> 00:30:05,430
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,325
Do you like it here?

630
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,929
What?

631
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:19,164
Do you like it here in New York?

632
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,199
Yeah.

633
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:23,568
What do you like better?

634
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:25,570
Recording here or at the beach?

635
00:32:26,304 --> 00:32:27,406
Here.

636
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,744
But I like the... I like the skaters.

637
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:32,945
You like the skaters?

638
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:35,647
Yeah.

639
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,984
Yeah, you know,
what I love about recording?

640
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:39,952
What I love about recording?

641
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,689
You can hear me?

642
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:45,390
- Yep.
- Oh, whatever, I'm so...

643
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,658
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no.

644
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,326
- No, just...
- Oh, okay, okay.

645
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,327
And in a way it's cool,

646
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,663
because you get
to keep these sounds, right?

647
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:52,799
You keep it forever.

648
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:54,599
You make like this mundane thing,

649
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:58,570
like be immortal, and that's cool and fun.

650
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:16,588
- Look here.
- Hey.

651
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:17,924
- Hey.
- What's up, man?

652
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:18,958
- Hey, what's up?
- Hello.

653
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:20,392
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Jesse.

654
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:21,259
- Jesse.
- Jesse, this is Fern.

655
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,307
- Fernando Thomas.
- Hello.

656
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:23,475
This is the sweetest man in New York.

657
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:25,932
He's gonna help take care
of you while I'm workin'.

658
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:30,535
Also notice how Johnny just like lights up?

659
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:31,636
I know.

660
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,271
He is like a... like a mini Johnny.

661
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,506
Right.

662
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,375
With the... with the...

663
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:38,991
- With the little hoods...
- Yeah, the little hoods.

664
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:40,378
And the flopsy hair.

665
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:41,914
What? Yeah.

666
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:43,482
- Just hangin' out.
- Uh-huh.

667
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:45,317
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, we're gonna

668
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,451
hold off till we eat more.

669
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:47,834
We're gonna hold off till we eat more.

670
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:49,721
I'm sorry.

671
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:53,358
We're gonna hold off till we eat more.

672
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,726
- It's right here.
- Mm-hmm.

673
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:56,461
So if you eat this, 'cause it's melting,

674
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,597
if you eat this as quick as you can,

675
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,466
not too fast, but just get
so many... A few more bites

676
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,740
and you can have the ice cream.

677
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:10,675
Go for it. You did it.

678
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,344
- Enough. Enough.
- Mm.

679
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:13,726
Craziest thing you've seen on the internet.

680
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:15,447
- Okay.
- Go.

681
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,884
So I... I like conspiracies.

682
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:18,951
Perfect.

683
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:19,919
- Great.
- Tell us...

684
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:20,753
Uh, let's eat...
Just a little bit of broccoli

685
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:21,754
- and then talk about...
- Yeah.

686
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:22,621
- I love conspiracies.
- Okay, a little bit

687
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:24,991
of broccoli and then we can talk? Uh-huh.

688
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:25,992
Yeah, and talk... then ou can
talk about conspiracies.

689
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:28,861
Yeah, the government
got, like, a colony of ants.

690
00:34:28,895 --> 00:34:30,009
This is how I think it happened.

691
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,531
- Okay.
- And like in the rock

692
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:34,499
and they place it inside a dead person.

693
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,102
- Okay.
- And they made him alive

694
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:39,437
and he has a plan...
planets of ants inside of him.

695
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:41,821
- Oh, ants...
- Oh, this is scary stuff.

696
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:42,909
- Fern.
- Do, um...

697
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:43,910
- Fern.
- Uh, I know one.

698
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:45,357
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, I'll show you SCP.

699
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,411
- Yeah.
- No screen time.

700
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:47,492
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Do SCP 1.

701
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:48,593
Not screen time right now, come on.

702
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:50,783
One of them, it was
a big thing that they found

703
00:34:50,817 --> 00:34:52,484
in like a forest

704
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:55,387
and they took the face off of it.

705
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,354
Wait, like...

706
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,623
And injected it with a bunch of injections

707
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:00,625
- to make it powerful.
- Whoa.

708
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:02,728
It was meant to be
like a government weapon...

709
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:05,031
...they were gonna use.

710
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:07,432
Do you... Do all your friends act like you?

711
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:10,368
And that would be a big no.

712
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,503
Johnny.

713
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:13,139
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

714
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:15,842
What up, Sunny Spa E Broadway?

715
00:35:17,076 --> 00:35:18,677
I don't know what that says.

716
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,859
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

717
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,947
- Whoa!
- Come on. Hey.

718
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,514
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Oh.

719
00:35:24,984 --> 00:35:26,118
Made it back.

720
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:28,653
And I was tired.

721
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:30,923
so tired,

722
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,025
but he wasn't.

723
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,828
So do you have your toothbrush,

724
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:38,097
- 'cause I don't see it.
- No.

725
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,511
Come on, I... I told you to pack it.

726
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:40,632
What? You didn't bring it?

727
00:35:40,665 --> 00:35:43,102
Um, I didn't.

728
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:45,637
Do you have trouble
expressing your emotion?

729
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,107
Well, I'm feeling
pretty frustrated right now.

730
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:49,541
That's good.

731
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:52,711
Just sit down, you can let it all come out.

732
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,142
Hey, you okay?

733
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:25,912
My friends don't talk like me, because...

734
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:29,547
I don't really have friends.

735
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,549
<i>I mostly hang out with adults.</i>

736
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,553
<i>No, Jesse, no. Back to bed.</i>

737
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:37,689
I did? I don't...
I don't remember saying that.

738
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:41,593
<i>I took him to the couch, I laid him down,</i>

739
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:44,529
<i>and I sat with him till he was asleep.</i>

740
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:50,937
<i>I got up and slowly started
walking back to my room.</i>

741
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,040
Can't I just sleep with you tonight?

742
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:58,144
Oh, why did you let me eat all that sugar?

743
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:59,946
Mom would not let me eat that.

744
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:04,250
Oh, my God, you said
that she would let you.

745
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:10,455
Can you tell me about Mom
when she was a little girl?

746
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,992
I said, "She was cute."

747
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:16,661
He said...

748
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,965
I heard about her boyfriends,

749
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:21,067
and she ran away, and she got in trouble

750
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,269
all the time.

751
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:26,939
And I heard that she got an abortion.

752
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:34,080
What the fuck do I say to that?

753
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,217
I didn't even know about it.

754
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:43,055
You know, a woman's body is, um,

755
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:48,227
like a... um, maybe every person.

756
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,763
Like you have the right...

757
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:52,164
...of your own body

758
00:37:52,198 --> 00:37:55,901
and a woman certainly has the right.

759
00:37:55,935 --> 00:37:58,037
It's like... it's called
"the right to choose".

760
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:01,107
Okay, now fuck that. Um...

761
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,676
Let me tell you
how my mom puts me to sleep.

762
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:07,046
Now, lay down.

763
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:11,117
Okay.

764
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,854
Rest your feet, rest your legs.

765
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:21,193
Rest your hands, rest your arms.

766
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,762
My mom would never do this.

767
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:26,531
Rest your eyes.

768
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,633
Rest your mouth.

769
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,904
Rest your jaw.

770
00:38:33,906 --> 00:38:35,174
Rest your mind.

771
00:38:36,342 --> 00:38:38,610
No more thoughts tonight.

772
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:39,845
No worries.

773
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,316
Just stars in the sky.

774
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,837
<i>So what? Does he have something that it...</i>

775
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,305
<i>Is it a sleeping problem?</i>

776
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:07,540
<i>Listen, he's probably</i>

777
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:09,942
<i>just over stimulated.
Did you give him sugar?</i>

778
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,178
<i>Did you let him watch shit
on your computer?</i>

779
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:13,979
No.

780
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:15,748
<i>'Cause that makes him crazy.</i>

781
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:19,185
You're just, uh, used to this.

782
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:20,820
Like, why are there so many scratches?

783
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:22,654
<i>I'm not used to it.</i>

784
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:24,622
<i>I fucking hate it sometimes.</i>

785
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,691
I mean, I love him more than I...

786
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:28,961
I can even understand

787
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:32,398
and that makes it even worse when I can

788
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:35,968
barely stand to be
in the same room with him,

789
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,183
<i>going on and on, talking, talking...</i>

790
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:38,404
Another stick.

791
00:39:38,437 --> 00:39:40,306
<i>Relentlessly about nothing
random nothingness,</i>

792
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:42,041
<i>interrupting every thought I might have...</i>

793
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:43,289
- Kick, kick, kick, kick.
- Oh, God, and I know.

794
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:44,210
From making him lunch and doing the dishes,

795
00:39:44,243 --> 00:39:46,045
from making lunch
and then doing the dishes,

796
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:47,692
from making dinner
and then doing the dishes,

797
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,161
from lunch, and then
going grocery shopping,

798
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,183
<i>on, and on, and on, and on, he never stops.</i>

799
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:52,284
Bees!

800
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:53,651
<i>It's a fucking nightmare.</i>

801
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:54,686
Yeah.

802
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:57,722
<i>Slow down!</i>

803
00:39:57,756 --> 00:39:59,657
Do you think I'm horrible now?

804
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:02,995
<i>No, no, I have so much sympathy.</i>

805
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,214
Listen, you just have to get
some protein into him, okay?

806
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:11,337
You know, those
disgusting little, uh, rolls,

807
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,240
the salami and cheese things,
just... He loves them.

808
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:18,277
Where are we going now?

809
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:19,979
I have to find you

810
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,181
some disgusting salami and cheese rolls.

811
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:30,022
<i>Historically,
New York represents the future</i>

812
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:33,225
<i>and possibility for so many immigrants.</i>

813
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:35,060
<i>We ask today's children of immigrants</i>

814
00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:37,062
<i>what they think about the future</i>

815
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:38,397
<i>and the world they live in now.</i>

816
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,133
<i>I never thought that I would be this scared</i>

817
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:44,336
<i>about like what might happen in the future,</i>

818
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,005
but then now,

819
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:47,406
I'm starting to think about it,

820
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:51,277
like, I can't... I can't...

821
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,813
<i>I just can't imagine animals going extinct,</i>

822
00:40:54,847 --> 00:40:58,284
<i>pollution, like, the Earth
dying, basically.</i>

823
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:03,721
<i>So my fears would be like loneliness</i>

824
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,224
<i>and, like, you know,</i>

825
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,294
<i>just like people not understanding you</i>

826
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,296
<i>even though they're there to understand you</i>

827
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:11,730
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

828
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:12,932
It's just really scary,

829
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:15,067
'cause it feels like you have nobody.

830
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,002
<i>My mom always tells me like,</i>

831
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:19,271
<i>"I hate kids that cry."</i>

832
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:22,341
<i>There was one time I told her,
"Oh, my gosh, I can...</i>

833
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,343
"Like, I could cry, uh,

834
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:27,112
"like, it's like a human thing
to do," and then she's like,

835
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:32,418
"No, you're supposed to be,
uh, strong and stuff."

836
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:36,822
So, yeah, I think
that's what I hate the most.

837
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:38,023
<i>When people end up saying,</i>

838
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:39,758
<i>"Oh, words don't hurt,"</i>

839
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,795
<i>it... like it gets to me so bad.</i>

840
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:44,997
<i>People will just judge you
without even knowing.</i>

841
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,779
<i>It's like not even their fault
that they don't know.</i>

842
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:49,301
They probably just wasn't raised like I am

843
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:52,338
knowing how to treat people,
how not to treat people.

844
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,006
<i>I don't like when everyone's</i>

845
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,375
<i>just in a stressed mindset</i>

846
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:59,278
and they're very closed into themselves.

847
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,247
They just don't speak to each other

848
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,015
and they're just like kind of hiding away

849
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:04,283
from like real life.

850
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:05,317
<i>I feel like people</i>

851
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:07,353
<i>who try to express their emotions,</i>

852
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:09,455
like they... they would get a lot of hate.

853
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:12,925
<i>It happened like more in the 20th century.</i>

854
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,061
<i>So instead of letting them be them,</i>

855
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:19,865
<i>they wanted to oppose them
in like bad horrible ways.</i>

856
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:23,402
<i>But I feel like now you could
speak your feelings easier,</i>

857
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:24,870
<i>but not easily.</i>

858
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,955
{\an8}Oh, sorry.

859
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,427

864
00:42:57,936 --> 00:42:59,238
{\an8}You're doing fancy texting.

865
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:01,040
{\an8}But I'm actually texting something.

866
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:02,207

868
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,312
{\an8}Oh, here it is.

869
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:11,450
All right, grab one of those
and I'll find toothpaste.

870
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:16,188
For some reason,
they're not in the same aisle.

You can't do that to somebody.

00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:49,261
for a second to grab toothpaste,

908
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:50,616
and then he disappeared.

909
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:52,684
So I'm runnin' after him,
tryin' to find him,

910
00:44:52,718 --> 00:44:54,486
and he jumps out, scares me,

911
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,491
and, yeah, I... I got angry
and I yelled at him.

I yelled at him.

<i>But it's okay also.</i>

919
00:45:14,373 --> 00:45:16,743
You know, you just have to explain to him

920
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:18,557
that you were scared,
and that's why you yelled,

921
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,279
and then you apologize, you know?

922
00:45:20,312 --> 00:45:23,282
He's... he's a person,
you just be honest with him.

00:47:24,737 --> 00:47:26,338
No, that's not true, Jesse.

966
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,440
You don't know what you're
talkin' about. She does!

967
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:30,242
Well, why do you think you're here?

968
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:31,510
Do you think that your mom

969
00:47:31,543 --> 00:47:33,245
really wants to be away from you?

970
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:34,747
Really?

971
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:36,281
She's tryin' to help your dad.

972
00:47:41,186 --> 00:47:42,654
Well, why does he need help?

973
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:48,660
He, um...

974
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,433
What's wrong with him?

975
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,369
He just... He...

976
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:05,310
Do you wanna call her?

977
00:48:10,315 --> 00:48:11,717
I want my mom.

978
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:23,395
Hey, I'm so sorry.

979
00:48:25,397 --> 00:48:27,566
Hey, hey, Jesse.

980
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:30,602
Jesse.

981

<i>I thought I was helping,</i>

982
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,942

983
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:11,176
I don't know even how.

984
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,959
<i>What... What does he know?
Did... Did he know?</i>

985
00:49:12,979 --> 00:49:14,379
<i>Does he know everything?</i>

986
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:17,850
Yeah, he knows.

987
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:21,720
Um, let me talk to him.

988
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,790

<i>Come on, just talk to her.</i>

991
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:27,760
<i>She's impossible.</i>

992
00:49:27,794 --> 00:49:30,362
<i>Hey, hey, hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

<i>Viv, you're... You're on speaker.</i>

994
00:49:33,866 --> 00:49:35,434
<i>Jesse, honey, listen to me,</i>

995
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:36,969
<i>your dad's gonna be fine.</i>

996
00:49:37,904 --> 00:49:39,438
<i>Okay?</i>

997
00:49:39,471 --> 00:49:40,740
Is it like before?

998
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:46,012
Yeah.

999
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:47,379
Yeah, it's like before,

1000
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:51,483
but he's gonna be fine, okay?

1001
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:54,252
<i>And I didn't wanna worry you,
but I messed up, okay?</i>

1002
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:55,687
<i>I should have told you, I'm sorry.</i>

1003
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:57,222
Tell her I'm fine.

1004
00:49:58,791 --> 00:49:59,926

00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:05,697
It's fine, it's fine.

1007
00:50:05,732 --> 00:50:08,300
Um, just tell him I love him
and I miss him, okay?

1008
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,902
<i>Okay.</i>

1009

<i>I'm gonna go get him.</i>

fighting about washing his hair,

1012
00:51:05,024 --> 00:51:08,027
'cause I could do that anytime.

1013
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:12,464
You don't wanna talk?

1014
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:15,400
Mm, I am talking.

- It is.

Hmm, sorry about that.

1021

It is harsh.

1022
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:36,923
Not even as a punishment, just,

1023
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:39,457
"Wash your hair, you dumb kids."

1024
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,393

Okay.

1028

Do you want to fight
about washing your hair

1029
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,878
and then I'll wash your hair?

1030
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:02,014
All right, I think we have
to wash your hair, young man.

- Yeah.
- In an indirect way

He wants to say something.

- Yeah.

- like real earnest.
- Yeah, sincere.

1077
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:45,084
And then, he just is like dismissive,

1078
00:53:45,117 --> 00:53:47,253
and makes me feel stupid,
and then I feel crushed...

Yeah.

He seems like he's doing good.

1084
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,496
He is, but he should be holding the mic

1085
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,565
if he wants to get that,
you hold the mic up.

1086

No, he's gotta find his own way!

00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:15,034

1137

1142
00:56:31,117 --> 00:56:32,418
...you know, there's, like,

1143
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:33,886
a lot of Chinese people actually,

1144
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:36,422
so it's not, like, hard to communicate.

1145
00:56:36,455 --> 00:56:39,058
<i>Sometimes in other places, I'm actually...</i>

1146
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:45,397
<i>You let Johnny interview you yet?</i>

1147
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:46,832
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

1148
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:48,834
<i>That seems like a smart move.</i>

1149
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:51,003
<i>Too many questions with that guy, right?</i>

1150
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:52,204
<i>Not enough answers.</i>

1151
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:55,341
<i>Oh, I miss you so much, babe.</i>

1152
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,209
<i>I miss you, too, Mama.</i>

1153
00:56:58,878 --> 00:57:00,045
Excuse me, please.

1154
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,915
Thank you.

1155
00:57:02,948 --> 00:57:05,417
We've been goin' around
the country asking kids

1156
00:57:05,451 --> 00:57:07,419
what they think the future would be like.

1157
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:09,355
Uh-huh.

1158
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:12,024
Um...

1159
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:13,859
If there's anything you don't wanna answer,

1160
00:57:14,827 --> 00:57:20,733
you can just say "skip" or "no,"

1161
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:24,370
or "I do not want to do this question".

1162
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:25,404
Okay.

1163
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:33,045
Why don't you and my mom
act like brother and sister?

1164
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,048
- This one?
- Yep.

1165
00:57:42,488 --> 00:57:44,323
Why are you alone?

1166
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:51,830
I mean, who cares? Blah, blah, blah.

1167
00:57:51,864 --> 00:57:55,167
The same...

1168
00:57:57,903 --> 00:57:59,872
Yeah, exactly, who cares?

1169
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:06,045
Did you tell my mom to leave
my dad when he first got sick?

1170
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,451
Did you?

1171
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:18,424
I told her to take care of herself.

1172
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,429
Blah, blah, blah.

1173
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:24,930
No, it's not blah, blah, blah.

1174
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:26,799
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1175
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,168
It is.

1176
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:30,369
Okay...

1177
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:31,450
- Means you did it.
- There were many things

1178
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:34,440
that were done,
and everybody said a lot of things,

1179
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,075
and there was a lot of concern,

1180
00:58:36,108 --> 00:58:38,377
and sometimes
we don't completely understand

1181
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,779
why we're doing the things
that we're doing, right?

1182
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:42,448
But I never did anything

1183
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:44,416
because I wanted to hurt your mom

1184
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,019
or hurt your dad or hurt you.

1185
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:49,989
I only wanted everything to be okay.

1186
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,161
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1187
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,199
Hmm.

1188
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:06,071
Maybe... Maybe it is blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1189
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:07,453
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1190
00:59:07,473 --> 00:59:09,541
Exactly.

1191
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,501
Coming from somewhere unknown,

1192
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:39,938
he's as tall as a small person!

1193
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:44,510
Jesse the Man!

1194
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:45,678
Watch it, man.

1195
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:48,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Have to do my expression, too.

1196
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:49,848
You can't just jump right into it, okay?

1197
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:52,418
- Go back.
- Do your introduction.

1198
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:53,519
All right!

1199
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:10,969
{\an8}It will destroy you!

1200
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:14,640
{\an8}That's how you do it.

1201
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:17,409
{\an8}Then, he just said,
"Pack my bag, get my stuff,

1202
01:00:17,443 --> 01:00:19,011
"take me to the hospital.

1203
01:00:19,044 --> 01:00:21,246
"If you don't, I'm just
gonna run away again, right?"

1204
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,348
Which is true.

1205
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:26,118
<i>So I took him to the ER,</i>

1206
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:28,587
<i>which was fucking awful.</i>

1207
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:30,422
Absolutely, Paul.

1208
01:00:30,456 --> 01:00:31,990
The milligrams have to be specific...

1209
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:33,105
We'll make sure that they are.

1210
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:33,992
Because Dr. Marklin said that,

1211
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:35,341
and he worked on it for three months,

1212
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:36,608
and it was still going back and forth.

1213
01:00:36,628 --> 01:00:37,777
Well, I'm not Dr. Marklin, I'm...

1214
01:00:37,797 --> 01:00:39,211
<i>I mean, you can't believe it, Johnny,</i>

1215
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:40,933
<i>it's so humiliating.</i>

1216
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:42,214
<i>They just asked him the same questions</i>

1217
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:43,349
<i>over and over, and over again.</i>

1218
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,670
I have been eating

1219
01:00:44,703 --> 01:00:47,106
and I have been sleeping the regular amount

1220
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:48,187
that I usually eat and sleep.

1221
01:00:48,207 --> 01:00:49,421
You ask me a question, I answer it,

1222
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,589
and then all of a sudden you ask her.

1223
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:51,977
Like, just why don't you ask her

1224
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,312
the goddamn question.

1225
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:55,347
<i>And then we finally
got him into a real center.</i>

1226
01:00:55,381 --> 01:00:57,082
I've done this before, I know it all.

1227
01:00:57,116 --> 01:00:58,430
Yeah, no shoelaces, you're right.

1228
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,551
<i>He was so scared.</i>

1229
01:00:59,585 --> 01:01:00,599
I'm gonna have you sign off

1230
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:01,387
that you're gonna be
taking those things home.

1231
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,156
- Okay, sure, right here?
- Yeah.

1232
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:06,992
And then when I was leaving,
he asked me in the sweetest...

1233
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:11,096
In the sweetest way if I could just stay

1234
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,432
until he was a little better.

1235
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,601
That's what he said,
"Just a little better."

1236
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:20,672
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1237
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:23,275
And I want Jesse to have his dad, you know?

1238
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:25,544
I mean, what the fuck can I do?

1239
01:01:25,577 --> 01:01:26,979
I've gotta...

1240
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:30,382
<i>Yeah, you gotta stay with him.</i>

1241
01:01:34,086 --> 01:01:36,155
<i>Really, Viv, we're doin' okay.</i>

1242
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:38,257
<i>You just take care of what you need to.</i>

1243
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,494
<i>Jesse can keep staying here with me.</i>

1244
01:01:44,731 --> 01:01:46,165
<i>We're havin' a great time.</i>

1245
01:01:50,602 --> 01:01:51,838
<i>I found someone in New Orleans</i>

1246
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:54,072
<i>who can get us kids
and I think we should do it.</i>

1247
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:54,973
Okay, I know,

1248
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,975
but I got Jesse and I just don't know

1249
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:59,578
if I can make that, um, trip right now.

1250
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:03,015
<i>Uh, I don't wanna go solo.</i>

1251
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:05,350
<i>No, it's sort of like</i>

1252
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:07,352
<i>we told, like, audiences, and funders...</i>

1253
01:02:07,386 --> 01:02:08,534
- Johnny!
- <i>And everybody that we...</i>

1254
01:02:08,554 --> 01:02:09,601
- Johnny!
- <i>...were gonna go</i>

1255
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:10,890
- <i>to multiple cities.</i>
- Johnny.

1256
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:11,758
- Johnny, let's go to the park.
- <i>I think we have to do it.</i>

1257
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,492
- Stop, stop. Please.
- Johnny.

1258
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:14,560
- Stop.
- <i>Unfortunately...</i>

1259
01:02:14,593 --> 01:02:15,641
- Get off your phone.
- Yeah, what?

1260
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:16,595
<i>Are...</i>

1261
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:18,297
<i>Are you... Are you with Jesse?</i>

1262
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,399
- <i>How's it going?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

1263
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:22,668
So what... Where we at with things?

1264
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:25,304
<i>I think New Orleans is a good idea.</i>

1265
01:02:25,337 --> 01:02:27,339
<i>I know someone down there.</i>

1266
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:29,208
<i>She can get us kids.</i>

1267
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:31,076
<i>We just need to tell them we wanna do that</i>

1268
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:32,177
<i>and then we can have Fern,</i>

1269
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:35,147
<i>like, start booking everything for us.</i>

1270
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,282
I know, but a lot...

1271
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,018
Jesse?

1272
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,153
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1273
01:02:41,186 --> 01:02:42,387
Hold on a second.

1274
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:44,757
Just, like, give me a sec.

1275
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:49,094
<i>You were jazzed about the idea
like two days ago.</i>

1276
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,196
- Jesse?
- <i>You were like we just need</i>

1277
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,664
<i>to get you back to that spot.</i>

1278
01:02:52,698 --> 01:02:54,466
This is not a great time.

1279
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,236
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
- I, uh...

1280
01:02:58,136 --> 01:03:00,539
Listen, let me, um...

1281
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:02,574
Let me call you back, okay?
I'll call you back.

1282
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:03,609
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

1283
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:07,145
Jesse?

1284
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:11,083
Jesse.

1285
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:17,556
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

1286
01:03:18,223 --> 01:03:19,591
Oh, fuck.

1287
01:03:20,526 --> 01:03:21,828
Oh.

1288
01:03:21,861 --> 01:03:23,195
Jesse?

1289
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:27,065
Jesse!

1290
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:29,668
Wait, wait! Jesse.

1291
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:31,670
Where'd you go?

1292
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:33,218
- I was right there!
- No, you weren't!

1293
01:03:33,238 --> 01:03:34,721
I was on the phone,
I turned around one second

1294
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:35,775
and you were gone!

1295
01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:37,543
Hey, listen, you can't do that,

1296
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:38,791
- you understand?
- You lost me!

1297
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:40,479
- I didn't lose you.
- You did.

1298
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:42,347
I lost you? Okay, okay, I lost you.

1299
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:44,349
I'm the worst uncle in the world!

1300
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,752
What... What are you doin'?

1301
01:03:45,785 --> 01:03:47,553
You, uh... Hey, come here!

1302
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:56,796
What are we doin' here, huh?

1303
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:58,196
I don't know.

1304
01:03:59,565 --> 01:04:02,367
That could have been really, really bad.

1305
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:04,703
I don't need you.

1306
01:04:11,376 --> 01:04:12,611
You so need me.

1307
01:04:19,585 --> 01:04:24,757
<i>He can feel how fucked up
things are right now, okay?</i>

1308
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:28,493
So in his... In his little
inarticulate kid way,

1309
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:31,563
he's saying, "I'm feeling
out of control right now.

1310
01:04:31,597 --> 01:04:33,231
"Can you handle it?

1311
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:36,501
"Can you take care of me feeling this way?

1312
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:39,872
"If I run away from you,
if I hide from you,

1313
01:04:39,906 --> 01:04:43,175
<i>"even if I jump on this bus,
am I gonna be okay?"</i>

1314
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:48,313
Oh, I'm just, like, in this fucking fantasy

1315
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:52,517
that you know,
I got everything under control

1316
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:54,486
and, uh, you know, I'll... I'll be there,

1317
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:55,935
I'll figure it out, I'll get you snacks,

1318
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,456
and I'll pack your bags,

1319
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:58,871
and we'll go off, I'm thinking of goin',

1320
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:00,726
"I don't know what the fuck I'm doing."

1321
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,361
Yeah.

1322
01:05:02,394 --> 01:05:03,763
Yeah, welcome to my fucking life.

1323
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:05,397
I... Nobody knows what they're doing.

1324
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,902
Nobody knows what
they're doing with these kids.

1325
01:05:09,936 --> 01:05:11,738
<i>You just have to keep doing it.</i>

1326
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,443
I ran up and down the street
calling out his name.

1327
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,782
I saw him from across the street

1328
01:05:22,815 --> 01:05:24,716
as a bus passed in front of me.

1329
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:26,284
I ran towards him,

1330
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:28,353
screaming out his name, "Jesse."

1331
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:33,191
He was mad at me, he was scared.

1332
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:39,197
He turned, and he walked away,
and got onto a bus.

1333
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:47,639
<i>I don't like feeling this,
but I feel like he's spoiled,</i>

1334
01:05:49,742 --> 01:05:50,943
<i>or I am.</i>

1335
01:05:59,284 --> 01:06:01,253
I can't believe you're doing this.

1336
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,529
I know, but I can't
take care of you right now.

1337
01:06:10,562 --> 01:06:11,998
- You can.
- No, but as soon

1338
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:14,834
as I get done with work,
I'll come out to LA and...

1339
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:16,601
And we'll do whatever you want.

1340
01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:18,370
All right? How do you like that?

1341
01:06:39,926 --> 01:06:41,593
My stomach hurts.

1342
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:45,530
I'm sorry.

1343
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:47,666
I need to poop.

1344
01:06:50,837 --> 01:06:52,905
- You do?
- Right now.

1345
01:06:52,939 --> 01:06:54,639
- Really?
- I need to poop.

1346
01:06:54,673 --> 01:06:56,241
You can't... you can't hold it.

1347
01:06:57,476 --> 01:06:58,878
I can't hold my poop.

1348
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,315
Okay. Um, excuse me, sir,
could you please pull over

1349
01:07:03,348 --> 01:07:04,984
at a gas station or diner?

1350
01:07:05,017 --> 01:07:07,419
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1351
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:09,254
Okay, just hold on.

1352
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:25,704
Okay, I'll be right back.

1353
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,742
Here.

1354
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:36,628
Hey, is there a bathroom he can use?

1355
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:37,984
- Down over there.
- Thank you.

1356
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:45,858
Okay, hold it, just hold, hold on.

1357
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:08,413
- You okay?
- No.

1358
01:08:10,116 --> 01:08:11,550
Okay, well, hurry up,

1359
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,303
'cause we got...
We gotta go to the airport.

1360
01:08:13,786 --> 01:08:15,620
- No.
- What?

1361
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:18,623
Are you going poop?

1362
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:20,325
No.

1363
01:08:22,494 --> 01:08:24,054
Do you even have to go to the bathroom?

1364
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:27,099
- Huh?
- No.

1365
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:36,008
You got me. You got me.

1366
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:38,077
You got me. You... Shit.

1367
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:45,617
All right, fun time's over, let's go.

1368
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,987
- Time to come out.
- No!

1369
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,589
Jesse, come out right now.

1370
01:08:50,622 --> 01:08:52,992
- No!
- Jesse, come out right now!

1371
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:55,527
I'm sorry.

1372
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,495
I'm sorry I hid,
I'm sorry I ran onto the bus,

1373
01:08:57,529 --> 01:08:59,799
I'm sorry, Johnny, I am sorry!

1374
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:02,835
I heard you talking on the phone.

1375
01:09:02,869 --> 01:09:04,436
You can't take care of me.

1376
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:07,874
I don't wanna go home.

1377
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:12,812
My mom is just gonna be sad about my dad

1378
01:09:12,845 --> 01:09:14,080
and my dad's not even there.

1379
01:09:26,025 --> 01:09:27,994
Okay.

1380
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:31,429
Okay.

1381
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:34,599
All right, just, um...

1382
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,668
I'll be right back, stay in there.

1383
01:10:18,778 --> 01:10:21,579
<i>New Orleans is like... Is very different.</i>

1384
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:24,016
<i>You don't see it anywhere else</i>

1385
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,583
<i>and, like, sometimes I understand</i>

1386
01:10:25,617 --> 01:10:26,886
<i>why people wanna come here,</i>

1387
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:29,521
<i>because it's like so beautiful
and just so different</i>

1388
01:10:29,554 --> 01:10:30,655
to where it's, like,

1389
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:33,658
sometimes we need something
different in our lives.

1390
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:35,828
<i>I feel like people
are sometimes being selfish</i>

1391
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:37,529
<i>when they come here, so they're like,</i>

1392
01:10:37,562 --> 01:10:39,832
<i>"Oh, I wanna go see something different,"</i>

1393
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:41,901
<i>but you're not takin' in consideration</i>

1394
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:43,668
<i>about where you are.</i>

1395
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,770
<i>If they keep it up,</i>

1396
01:10:44,804 --> 01:10:47,605
<i>like buildin' Airbnbs and everything,</i>

1397
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:48,808
<i>all of it is gonna be gone.</i>

1398
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:51,609
There is not gonna be a New Orleans,

1399
01:10:51,643 --> 01:10:55,147
but I also think that, like, we, as people

1400
01:10:55,181 --> 01:10:57,750
and who live in New Orleans,
make it New Orleans.

1401
01:10:57,783 --> 01:10:59,885
Yes.

1402
01:11:02,188 --> 01:11:03,823
<i>- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.</i>

1403
01:11:03,856 --> 01:11:05,091
This is Jesse.

1404
01:11:05,124 --> 01:11:06,524
Nice meeting you, Jesse. I'm Sunni.

1405
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:07,625
- Hey.
- Hey.

1406
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:09,261
- Thank you for having us.
- Absolutely.

1407
01:11:09,295 --> 01:11:10,642
- Come on in, come on in.
- I'm excited.

1408
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:11,944
- Hi, I'm Fern.
- Hey, how are you?

1409
01:11:11,964 --> 01:11:13,966
Hey, Fern. Nice meeting you.

1410
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,069
Through this way in the kitchen here,

1411
01:11:17,103 --> 01:11:20,973
and then there are two rooms back here.

1412
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:25,311
So Johnny and Jesse, I figure,
you can be here.

1413
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:26,611
There's a bathroom...

1414
01:11:29,882 --> 01:11:32,818
She mentioned that she doesn't think

1415
01:11:32,852 --> 01:11:34,699
that humans are innately
violent, which I thought

1416
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,588
- was really interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

1417
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:39,058
Um, and she said she thinks the violence

1418
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:40,826
- took place a long time ago.
- Mm-hmm.

1419
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,694
And has just been passed down.

1420
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:43,796
- Passed down?
- Yeah.

1421
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:46,298
- She did speak about it.
- And then she said that, um,

1422
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:48,300
it's in people's genetic makeup.

1423
01:11:48,334 --> 01:11:50,936
But we have the power...

1424
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,218
- There you go.
- ...to override that.

1425
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:53,352
- Yeah.
- Which I was like...

1426
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:54,606
- Yeah.
- ...wow!

1427
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,856
I'm like, "What PDFs are you reading?"

1428
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:58,643
What?

1429
01:11:58,676 --> 01:12:00,813
Yeah, can you believe...

1430
01:12:00,846 --> 01:12:04,016
<i>So my fears would be like loneliness</i>

1431
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:07,319
<i>and like people not understanding you</i>

1432
01:12:07,353 --> 01:12:09,654
<i>even though, they're there
to understand you</i>

1433
01:12:09,687 --> 01:12:10,823
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

1434
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:11,924
<i>It's just really scary,</i>

1435
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:13,625
<i>'cause it feels like you have nobody.</i>

1436
01:12:15,861 --> 01:12:17,763
<i>All right, listen, it's lesson time.</i>

1437
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:22,768
"So first, as the adult,

1438
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:29,341
"take time for the sad, mad,

1439
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,945
"or scared feelings
to work their way through.

1440
01:12:32,978 --> 01:12:36,082
"How this happens will
depend on your personality.

1441
01:12:37,216 --> 01:12:40,019
"Calmly invite your child to hear you out.

1442
01:12:40,052 --> 01:12:45,723
"You can try, 'Hey, I made a mistake

1443
01:12:45,758 --> 01:12:47,893
"'and I would like
to talk to you about that.

1444
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:48,961
"'May I come in?'"

1445
01:12:50,362 --> 01:12:51,629
Sure.

1446
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:56,634
"Try to..."

1447
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,004
"Try... Try something like,

1448
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,642
"'Did you feel hurt that
I was gonna send you home?'"

1449
01:13:06,412 --> 01:13:07,679
Yeah, I did.

1450
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:10,682
Yeah.

1451
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:16,255
Uh, then I say...

1452
01:13:20,059 --> 01:13:22,128
"I feel badly about how I behaved.

1453
01:13:23,863 --> 01:13:25,097
"Are you feeling mad at me?

1454
01:13:25,898 --> 01:13:27,933
"It's okay if you are

1455
01:13:27,967 --> 01:13:30,936
"and I'd like to hear whatever
you're feeling and thinking."

1456
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,371
Mmm...

1457
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:36,976
I thought that you were
being a pain in the ass.

1458
01:13:39,812 --> 01:13:40,946
Yeah.

1459
01:13:42,114 --> 01:13:44,817
Then, "I..."

1460
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,420
"I am feeling very..." Use a feeling word.

1461
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:55,027
Shitty, stupid, totally out of touch,

1462
01:13:55,895 --> 01:14:01,300
and also, um, sad.

1463
01:14:05,171 --> 01:14:07,239
Sorry, I shouldn't.

1464
01:14:07,273 --> 01:14:09,008
"Then, from the bottom of your heart,

1465
01:14:10,276 --> 01:14:13,145
"look your child in the eye
and say you're sorry."

1466
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,955
Oh, come on.

1467
01:14:22,988 --> 01:14:24,156
Say it.

1468
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:28,327
I'm sorry.

1469
01:14:31,797 --> 01:14:32,798
I'm sorry, too.

1470
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:36,035
Your mom does all this?

1471
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:37,383
Yeah, but she doesn't have to read it

1472
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:39,872
from a stupid phone.

1473
01:14:39,905 --> 01:14:42,107
Now, no more phone time for you.

1474
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:44,843
No more... No more screen time.

1475
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,922
Can I sleep with you?

1476
01:14:56,956 --> 01:14:58,958
- Hmm?
- Can I sleep with you?

1477
01:14:59,391 --> 01:15:01,360
Yeah. Hmm.

1478
01:15:19,812 --> 01:15:21,013
Can I be an orphan?

1479
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:23,282
Mm-hmm.

1480
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:24,984
You okay?

1481
01:15:25,017 --> 01:15:26,485
I just want to be the orphan.

1482
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:27,519
Okay.

1483
01:15:31,023 --> 01:15:32,358
Is there anything about my past

1484
01:15:32,391 --> 01:15:33,826
you'd like to ask me?

1485
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:39,098
What was your mom like?

1486
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:40,466
She was nice.

1487
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:42,401
Hmm, yeah.

1488
01:15:44,303 --> 01:15:45,404
Do you remember her?

1489
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:48,040
<i>Yeah.</i>

1490
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,277
<i>She always took baths,</i>

1491
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:53,245
<i>but she'd have like
she never got to take 'em,</i>

1492
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:55,914
<i>but she always took them.</i>

1493
01:15:55,948 --> 01:15:58,517
<i>When she'd get home from work,
she cleaned up the kitchen,</i>

1494
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,185
<i>all bangy and loud.</i>

1495
01:16:00,219 --> 01:16:02,955
Then I'd say, "Why are you being so loud?

1496
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:03,856
"Are you mad?"

1497
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:06,025
Then she'd say, "I'm not being loud."

1498
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:12,197
<i>She wrote books, fiction and non-fiction.</i>

1499
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:16,468
<i>She's always singing old songs</i>

1500
01:16:16,502 --> 01:16:17,569
<i>from when she was a kid.</i>

1501
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:30,182
<i>She thought about weird things, like ghosts</i>

1502
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:34,520
and incarnation, all that stuff.

1503
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:36,021
She'd loved it here.

1504
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:39,858
<i>She taught her classes.</i>

1505
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:41,260
<i>When she was stressed out,</i>

1506
01:16:41,293 --> 01:16:43,529
<i>she would just cook herself a big steak</i>

1507
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,130
<i>and just eat it.</i>

1508
01:16:46,532 --> 01:16:48,567
<i>She loved hanging out with her friends.</i>

1509
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:55,474
<i>She says even though we love each other,</i>

1510
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:58,077
<i>she'll never know everything about me</i>

1511
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:01,146
<i>and I'll never know everything about her.</i>

1512
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,548
<i>It's just the way it is.</i>

1513
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,492
Stop.

1514
01:17:13,525 --> 01:17:15,361
- Um...
- You're weird.

1515
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:17,363
Okay, yeah. Time to screen time as much

1516
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:18,477
- screen time as he wants.
- Okay.

1517
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:19,578
He can watch anything he wants.

1518
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:20,366
All the screen time he wants.
Here, here, here, here.

1519
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:21,233
R-rated, anything, anything he wants.

1520
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:22,281
You know, here's your screen time.

1521
01:17:22,301 --> 01:17:25,104
- Yeah, give it to him.
- Here's your screen time.

1522
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:26,685
You have to mak sure
your eyelids stay open.

1523
01:17:26,705 --> 01:17:28,273
Get as much screen time as possible.

1524
01:17:28,307 --> 01:17:30,542
If he cries or anything,
no screen time, all right?

1525
01:17:30,576 --> 01:17:32,244
- All right.
- Yeah.

1526
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:34,079
Okay, that was it,
that was your screen time.

1527
01:17:34,113 --> 01:17:35,280
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1528
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:36,348
Do you feel screenful?

1529
01:17:36,382 --> 01:17:37,549
I feel screenful.

1530
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:38,984
- Yeah.
- Screenish.

1531
01:17:39,017 --> 01:17:41,420
So do you feel like adults understand

1532
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:43,522
what kids are going through?

1533
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:48,560
Um, I definitely think lots of moms do,

1534
01:17:48,594 --> 01:17:52,664
because... I think they do.

1535
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:54,299
<i>I'm curious, like, you said this was</i>

1536
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,201
<i>one of the hardest hit areas of Katrina,</i>

1537
01:17:56,235 --> 01:17:58,637
<i>like, what are the stories you've heard?</i>

1538
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,274
<i>Um, a guy died in this house,</i>

1539
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:05,344
but I like to believe that ghosts are nice

1540
01:18:05,377 --> 01:18:08,213
and they don't try to scare people,

1541
01:18:09,181 --> 01:18:11,083
unless that's their intention.

1542
01:18:11,116 --> 01:18:12,418
Tell me about that, uh,

1543
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:14,219
tattoo you've got on your arm.

1544
01:18:14,253 --> 01:18:15,554
- It is nothing.
- Oh!

1545
01:18:15,587 --> 01:18:17,222
his is what I... I've learned

1546
01:18:17,256 --> 01:18:18,724
about Devante so far.

1547
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:21,126
<i>Devante is like, "My business is mine.</i>

1548
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,327
<i>"What's about that?</i>

1549
01:18:22,361 --> 01:18:22,961
<i>"I don't feel like talking
about that right now."</i>

1550
01:18:22,995 --> 01:18:24,062
<i>"What's the tattoo?"</i>

1551
01:18:24,096 --> 01:18:25,631
<i>"Don't worry about what's the tattoo."</i>

1552
01:18:25,664 --> 01:18:27,232
You know, this kinda thing.

1553
01:18:27,266 --> 01:18:29,401
So, uh, you know,
what I appreciate about you?

1554
01:18:29,435 --> 01:18:32,404
I appreciate the fact that you, um...

1555
01:18:32,438 --> 01:18:36,074
You hold what is sacred, right?

1556
01:18:36,108 --> 01:18:39,178
<i>So what do you think
happens to you after you die?</i>

1557
01:18:39,211 --> 01:18:41,180
<i>Well, me and my mom are Baptists.</i>

1558
01:18:41,213 --> 01:18:43,582
<i>Uh, well, I would say heaven, I feel.</i>

1559
01:18:43,615 --> 01:18:45,117
<i>I don't know how it would be like,</i>

1560
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:49,188
but what I imagine it, uh,
I would say a meadow

1561
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:52,090
with a one big tree,

1562
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:55,093
and you just lay on the grass with flowers

1563
01:18:55,127 --> 01:18:58,096
and you just stare up into the sun

1564
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:00,399
with a lot of breeze, obviously.

1565
01:19:00,432 --> 01:19:02,367
You don't want it to be too hot.

1566
01:19:02,401 --> 01:19:05,537
Yeah, that's what I kind of imagine.

1567
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:08,173
That's really beautiful.

1568
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:11,643
<i>Do you think that the world is fair?</i>

1569
01:19:11,677 --> 01:19:15,347
<i>No, nothing's really that fair.</i>

1570
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,149
<i>There's always gonna be, uh,</i>

1571
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:18,584
<i>like, probably gonna be more war,</i>

1572
01:19:18,617 --> 01:19:21,186
since there's more things to fight about

1573
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:25,792
if you keep on building
onto what's in the past.

1574
01:19:25,825 --> 01:19:28,795
<i>What causes flooding within yourself,</i>

1575
01:19:28,828 --> 01:19:30,329
<i>within whether it's in your mind,</i>

1576
01:19:30,362 --> 01:19:32,397
<i>within your heart, within your spirit?</i>

1577
01:19:32,431 --> 01:19:35,768
What causes flooding, um, within you?

1578
01:19:37,703 --> 01:19:41,607
Um, I think it would be, like,

1579
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,576
not, like, feeling that,

1580
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,546
like I said no one cares
or, like, just feeling that

1581
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:50,449
I'm, like, alone sometimes.

1582
01:19:50,482 --> 01:19:52,251
<i>But I know a lot of kids are saying,</i>

1583
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:54,152
"Oh, the world's gonna end and all that."

1584
01:19:54,186 --> 01:19:56,255
I don't think the world's gonna end.

1585
01:19:56,288 --> 01:19:59,057
I just think the world's
not gonna be as clean

1586
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,726
as it used to be.

1587
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,162
Say if your parents were your children...

1588
01:20:06,465 --> 01:20:09,201
What's something
you would want them to learn?

1589
01:20:09,234 --> 01:20:12,070
What's something you would teach 'em?

1590
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:15,842
Not to be selfish,
not to be bad, and not to...

1591
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:19,244
And not to disrespect, and not to have...

1592
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:22,581
And to have close feelings

1593
01:20:22,614 --> 01:20:25,752
for your friends, your parents,

1594
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:30,222
and not to be...

1595
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:33,125
<i>if I were the one to be a lead.</i>

1596
01:20:36,528 --> 01:20:39,598
If you could change
one thing about yourself,

1597
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:41,099
what would it be?

1598
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:45,237
My attitude.

1599
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,685
Hey, what's wrong with your attitude?

1600
01:20:46,705 --> 01:20:48,253
You seem like you have a great attitude.

1601
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:49,753
What would you change about yourself?

1602
01:20:50,342 --> 01:20:52,177
My anger.

1603
01:20:56,548 --> 01:21:00,252
"There, colors, sensations, and sounds

1604

01:21:03,255 --> 01:21:05,691
"You will see so many living things."

1606
01:21:05,724 --> 01:21:07,794
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

1607
01:21:07,827 --> 01:21:09,695
"Beyond imagining..."

1608
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:10,797
How's it going?

1609
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:12,244
- "Sensations and sounds..."
- Thank you.

1610
01:21:12,264 --> 01:21:14,266
"...will wash over you constantly."

1611
01:21:14,299 --> 01:21:16,836
- No problem.
- Hey. You're good?

1612
01:21:16,869 --> 01:21:18,136
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

1613
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,304
- Yeah.
- What happened?

1614
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:20,439
No. It's okay.

1615
01:21:20,472 --> 01:21:22,341
He just... There were some tears...

1616
01:21:22,374 --> 01:21:23,555
- Why?
- ...we ran out of snacks,

1617
01:21:23,575 --> 01:21:25,344
the iPad died,
it was like thing after thing.

1618
01:21:25,377 --> 01:21:26,511
We only have raisins left.

1619
01:21:26,545 --> 01:21:27,847
- Shit.
- We don't like raisins.

1620
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,581
I didn't plan well, I'm so sorry.

1621
01:21:29,615 --> 01:21:30,850
No, don't cuss.

1622
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:31,918
Hey, sorry.

1623
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:33,352
- It's fine.
- You all right?

1624
01:21:33,385 --> 01:21:34,787
Yeah, I'm gonna go find Maurice.

1625
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:36,188
- Okay.
- And I'll be back.

1626
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:37,222
Thanks, Fern.

1627
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:40,392
Hey.

1628
01:21:40,425 --> 01:21:41,928
- Hey.
- You okay?

1629
01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:43,395
I'm embarrassed.

1630
01:21:43,428 --> 01:21:45,464
- You're embarrassed?
- That I cried.

1631
01:21:45,497 --> 01:21:46,846
You're embarrassed that you cried,

1632
01:21:46,866 --> 01:21:48,200
don't be embarrassed.

1633
01:21:48,233 --> 01:21:50,202
Because I don't usually cry that much.

1634
01:21:50,235 --> 01:21:51,370
Huh?

1635
01:21:51,403 --> 01:21:53,338
I don't usually cry that much.

1636
01:21:53,372 --> 01:21:54,373
It's okay.

1637
01:21:56,909 --> 01:21:59,444
It's all right.

1638
01:21:59,478 --> 01:22:00,646
You mad at me?

1639
01:22:02,381 --> 01:22:03,548
Mmm-mmm.

1640
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,184

1641
01:22:07,586 --> 01:22:09,388

exhausted I can't sleep.</i>

1702
01:25:25,717 --> 01:25:29,454
Taking care of him and working
at the same time is...

1703
01:25:29,487 --> 01:25:30,857
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- ...a little too much.

1704

<i>So tomorrow, I'm gonna take him to a parade</i>

1706

<i>that Sunni told me about.</i>

1707
01:25:40,532 --> 01:25:42,068
You're doing so good.

1708
01:25:43,535 --> 01:25:45,805
<i>Yeah, he's been such a trouper,</i>

1709
01:25:45,838 --> 01:25:47,539
<i>I feel like I owe him a good time.</i>

1710
01:25:53,511 --> 01:25:55,547
<i>Even though, he, um, keeps asking me</i>

1711
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:56,715
<i>why we don't talk.</i>

1712
01:25:57,149 --> 01:25:58,617
Oh!

1713
01:26:00,186 --> 01:26:02,520
Cool. I like this kid.

1714
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:04,757
<i>And what do you say?</i>

1715
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:09,594
Apparently, some bullshit.

1716
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:11,496
<i>He didn't let you
get away with that, did he?</i>

1717
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:14,432
<i>No.</i>

1718
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:16,434
<i>I just don't know what to do anymore.</i>

1719
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:18,971
<i>I'll probably run out of bullshit I guess.</i>

1720
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:24,944
Well, you could tell him the truth.

1721
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:27,113
<i>That sounds fun.</i>

1722
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:28,866
<i>Just tell your
9-year-old the truth. What...</i>

1723
01:26:29,782 --> 01:26:31,583
<i>Which... Which part?</i>

1724
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:32,684
That I...

1725
01:26:35,687 --> 01:26:37,602
messed up with you and Paul,
that I got in the middle

1726
01:26:37,622 --> 01:26:39,025
of something I didn't understand?

1727
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:40,826
That part?

1728
01:26:43,262 --> 01:26:44,964
Oh, yeah, that's good.

1729
01:26:44,997 --> 01:26:47,166
That's... That's a really good start.

1730
01:26:50,937 --> 01:26:54,673
Or was it when Mom died, we got in...

1731
01:26:54,706 --> 01:26:57,043
into all that weird shit when Mom died.

1732
01:26:57,076 --> 01:26:58,677
That part?

1733
01:27:01,781 --> 01:27:04,683
You mean, like all that weird shit

1734
01:27:04,716 --> 01:27:07,552
of our entire lives? That stuff?

1735
01:27:07,585 --> 01:27:10,122
<i>Yeah, our entire lives.</i>

1736
01:27:12,925 --> 01:27:15,027
<i>Or was it when Louisa left me</i>

1737
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:20,066
and everything just exploded.

1738
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:24,621
You know, that's the first
time you've said that.

1739
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:27,039
<i>Yeah, which part?</i>

1740
01:27:28,606 --> 01:27:29,674
All of it.

1741
01:27:51,263 --> 01:27:52,597
Johnny.

1742
01:27:54,599 --> 01:27:56,168
Johnny. Johnny, Johnny!

1743
01:27:57,269 --> 01:27:58,270
Johnny.

1744
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:00,572
I'm okay.

1745
01:28:00,605 --> 01:28:02,008
- You okay?
- Are you all right?

1746
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,575
- Uh, I'm okay.
- Johnny.

1747
01:28:03,608 --> 01:28:04,944
- I'm okay.
- Stop, Johnny!

1748
01:28:04,977 --> 01:28:06,045
Johnny!

1749
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:07,213
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1750
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:08,326
Take it slow. Take it slow.

1751
01:28:08,347 --> 01:28:09,714
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Okay.

1752
01:28:09,749 --> 01:28:11,017
<i>It's okay.</i>

1753
01:28:19,992 --> 01:28:21,127
Did I drop you?

1754
01:28:22,028 --> 01:28:23,329
I jumped.

1755
01:28:23,362 --> 01:28:25,798
Okay, good move.

1756
01:28:25,831 --> 01:28:26,911
I don't know what that was.

1757
01:28:28,034 --> 01:28:29,168
You fainted.

1758
01:28:29,902 --> 01:28:31,103
What?

1759
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:44,682
Okay, I fainted.

1760
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:53,092
Uh, maybe we shouldn't
talk about it with anyone,

1761
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,995
'cause it's embarrassing.

1762
01:28:56,028 --> 01:28:57,830
It's not embarrassing!

1763
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,269
That must have been scary for you.

1764
01:29:05,738 --> 01:29:07,006
Nah-uh.

1765
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,341
No, really?

1766
01:29:10,342 --> 01:29:11,709
I was fine.

1767
01:29:15,014 --> 01:29:16,816
I don't think I was fine

1768
01:29:16,849 --> 01:29:18,784
and I don't think you were fine.

1769
01:29:29,028 --> 01:29:30,763
We have a zone of resiliency.

1770
01:29:32,064 --> 01:29:35,234
When we're out of the zone,
we can meditate.

1771
01:29:35,267 --> 01:29:37,107
Just think of something
that can bring you joy.

1772
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:39,238
When you're stressed out,

1773
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:41,140
you can use some of these techniques.

1774
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:45,344
Shoulder-tapping, rock-tossing.

1775
01:29:48,214 --> 01:29:49,681
Finger-touching.

1776
01:29:53,452 --> 01:29:55,855
Or mindful breathing.

1777
01:30:05,164 --> 01:30:10,668
And, or you can just shake it off...

1778
01:30:12,338 --> 01:30:13,705
Yeah.

1779
01:30:17,309 --> 01:30:18,944
That's amazing.

1780
01:30:18,978 --> 01:30:20,179
Thank you.

1781
01:30:28,187 --> 01:30:29,654
Do you think we're alike?

1782
01:30:32,992 --> 01:30:34,193
God, no.

1783
01:30:36,862 --> 01:30:38,063
Yeah, we are.

1784
01:30:40,132 --> 01:30:41,934
- We are, we are.
- No, we are not.

1785
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:43,135
No, we are not.

1786
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:45,004
- Yeah, we are.
- No, we're not.

1787
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:47,973
No, we are not!

1788
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:52,044
- Well, I wanna be.
- I don't faint like you do.

1789
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:53,279
No.

1790
01:30:57,383 --> 01:30:59,385
<i>But I know a lot of kids are saying,</i>

1791
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:01,320
<i>"Oh, the world's gonna end" and all that.</i>

1792
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:03,322
<i>I don't think the world's gonna end.</i>

1793
01:31:03,355 --> 01:31:06,325
<i>I just think the world's
not gonna be as clean</i>

1794
01:31:06,358 --> 01:31:10,029
<i>or as easy to get around or easy to breathe</i>

1795
01:31:10,062 --> 01:31:12,198
<i>or easy stuff like that.</i>

1796
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:15,134
<i>Yeah. Thank you so much.</i>

1797
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:16,368
<i>This was really fun.</i>

1798
01:31:27,379 --> 01:31:29,415
Have you ever thought about the future?

1799
01:31:29,448 --> 01:31:32,218
Oh...

1800
01:31:32,251 --> 01:31:34,053
Have you ever thought about the future?

1801
01:31:34,553 --> 01:31:36,422
Uh, yeah.

1802
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:38,357
Uh, whatever you plan on happening,

1803
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:40,459
never happens.

1804
01:31:40,492 --> 01:31:43,229
Stuff you would never think of happens.

1805
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:47,900
So you just have to... you have to come on,

1806
01:31:47,933 --> 01:31:51,036
come on, come on, come on, come on,

1807
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:53,272
come on, come on, come on,

1808
01:31:53,305 --> 01:31:58,277
<i>come on, come on, come on, come on.</i>

1809
01:32:00,012 --> 01:32:02,815
<i>Uh, so he slept.</i>

1810
01:32:02,848 --> 01:32:04,283
<i>He slept for two whole nights</i>

1811
01:32:04,316 --> 01:32:06,352
<i>and he's responding to his meds,</i>

1812
01:32:06,385 --> 01:32:09,221
<i>so the doctor said
he can do outpatient care.</i>

1813
01:32:09,255 --> 01:32:11,056
<i>He just told me he can go home.</i>

1814
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:12,324
- He did?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1815
01:32:13,559 --> 01:32:16,362
Wow. Um...

1816
01:32:16,395 --> 01:32:18,530
<i>And how are you? You doin' all right?</i>

1817
01:32:20,432 --> 01:32:22,534
I don't know. Yeah, just fine.

1818
01:32:26,071 --> 01:32:28,007
<i>Um, you wanna tell Jesse now?</i>

1819
01:32:30,409 --> 01:32:31,910
Yeah.

1820
01:32:31,944 --> 01:32:33,345
Johnny, thank you so much.

1821
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:36,015
<i>Okay.</i>

1822
01:32:36,048 --> 01:32:37,449
Jesse, it's your mom.

1823
01:32:41,487 --> 01:32:43,188
Hello.

1824
01:32:43,222 --> 01:32:45,124
<i>Hi, sweetie, how are you?</i>

1825
01:32:45,157 --> 01:32:47,126
- I'm good.
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

1826
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:50,896
<i>So listen, your dad's doing so much better.</i>

1827
01:32:50,929 --> 01:32:52,378
<i>The doctors are gonna keep helping him,</i>

1828
01:32:52,398 --> 01:32:55,301
<i>but they thought
he was well enough to go home.</i>

1829
01:32:55,334 --> 01:32:57,136
<i>So I'm gonna come get you, okay?</i>

1830
01:32:58,003 --> 01:32:59,371
<i>I'm just driving Moses home</i>

1831
01:32:59,405 --> 01:33:02,841
<i>and then I'm gonna be on
the first flight out tomorrow.</i>

1832
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:05,244
<i>Oh, I'm so excited,
I can't wait to see you.</i>

1833
01:33:05,577 --> 01:33:06,578
Yep.

1834
01:33:08,113 --> 01:33:09,315
- <i>Jesse?</i>
- Oh, take the phone,

1835
01:33:09,348 --> 01:33:10,883
take the phone, take the phone!

1836
01:33:10,916 --> 01:33:13,218
<i>Jesse. Sweetie, are you there?</i>

1837
01:33:15,154 --> 01:33:16,221
<i>Jesse?</i>

1838
01:33:48,153 --> 01:33:50,189
You don't have to follow me everywhere.

1839
01:33:51,957 --> 01:33:53,325
Come on, man.

1840
01:33:57,229 --> 01:33:59,231
I'm fine.

1841
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,266
Oh, yeah?

1842
01:34:02,568 --> 01:34:04,002
You can be not fine.

1843
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:08,040
But I'm fine.

1844
01:34:08,073 --> 01:34:11,076
Okay, you know,
when you're not in your zone,

1845
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:13,045
like, your zone of resiliency, it's...

1846
01:34:15,314 --> 01:34:18,317
It's okay to not be fine, you know?

1847
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:20,552
Like, you can be

1848
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,990
you know, angry, and... And sad,

1849
01:34:25,023 --> 01:34:27,559
and... And lost, and confused,

1850
01:34:28,293 --> 01:34:29,495
and that's okay.

1851
01:34:30,429 --> 01:34:32,398
But I'm fine!

1852
01:34:32,431 --> 01:34:34,500
Okay, but if you're ever not fine,

1853
01:34:34,533 --> 01:34:37,469
you can kick the air, you can throw a fit,

1854
01:34:37,503 --> 01:34:38,971
you can yell,

1855
01:34:39,004 --> 01:34:41,340
- and it would be okay.
- I'm fine!

1856
01:34:41,373 --> 01:34:42,621
It'd be a totally reasonable response!

1857
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:44,376
It'd be reasonable!

1858
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,612
- You're not fine.
- I'm fine!

1859
01:34:48,447 --> 01:34:50,582
Yeah, I'm not fine!

1860
01:34:50,616 --> 01:34:51,751
I'm fine!

1861
01:34:51,785 --> 01:34:56,288
I'm not fine and that's
a totally reasonable response!

1862
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:00,192
Come on, man.

1863
01:35:02,094 --> 01:35:03,128
Yeah.

1864
01:35:04,463 --> 01:35:06,465
- I'm not fine!
- Yeah.

1865
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:09,201
And that is a totally reasonable response!

1866
01:35:09,234 --> 01:35:12,371
Yeah. This is fucked up
and that makes sense!

1867
01:35:12,404 --> 01:35:15,541
This is fucked up and that makes sense!

1868
01:35:15,574 --> 01:35:18,710
How could this
being so fucked up make sense?

1869
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:20,379
It's fucked!

1870
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:42,201
Yeah.

1871
01:35:48,574 --> 01:35:50,642
Are you laughing or crying?
I can't... I can't tell.

1872
01:35:50,676 --> 01:35:52,196
I wanna have the appropriate reaction.

1873
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,715
Hey, man, come here.

1874
01:35:59,051 --> 01:36:00,252
Let me... Let me look at you.

1875
01:36:00,285 --> 01:36:01,687
- Mm.
- Are you laughing?

1876
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,522
Is that a smile?

1877
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:05,224
Is that your big stupid smile?

1878
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,201
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1879
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:17,336
All right.

1880
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:19,505
Are you gonna faint?

1881
01:36:20,506 --> 01:36:21,774
No.

1882
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:28,313
I got my shoulder-touching, finger-tapping,

1883
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:29,615
rock-throwing.

1884
01:36:29,648 --> 01:36:31,283
Why are you throwing rocks, by the way?

1885
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:35,721
Do you think I'm gonna
be like my dad when I'm older?

1886
01:36:37,222 --> 01:36:39,091
I think you have it better, Jesse.

1887
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:40,659
Why?

1888
01:36:42,661 --> 01:36:45,264
'Cause you are just... I don't know.

1889
01:36:45,297 --> 01:36:46,398
You know yourself more,

1890
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:49,535
you're able to like express yourself

1891
01:36:49,568 --> 01:36:52,337
and your feeling, that's
what your mom taught you.

1892
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:56,642
So you are way ahead
of the game, believe me.

1893
01:36:57,609 --> 01:36:59,144
Means you're looking better.

1894
01:37:06,418 --> 01:37:08,086
Lots of blah, blah, blah.

1895
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,621
Lots of blah, blah, blah.

1896
01:37:10,689 --> 01:37:14,761
Be funny, comma, when you can, period.

1897
01:37:15,427 --> 01:37:16,528
What's that?

1898
01:37:16,562 --> 01:37:18,363
My dad used to say that to me.

1899
01:37:18,397 --> 01:37:19,832
- Really?
- Yeah.

1900
01:37:20,432 --> 01:37:21,700
That's funny.

1901
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,404
Hi!

1902
01:37:25,437 --> 01:37:27,439
Mama!

1903
01:37:40,218 --> 01:37:41,486
- Hi.
- Hi.

1904
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,423
- Hi.
- Hi, hi, hi.

1905
01:37:44,456 --> 01:37:45,691
- Hi.
- Oh.

1906
01:37:50,596 --> 01:37:52,364
Hey. Hey.

1907
01:37:59,237 --> 01:38:02,441
...two, three...

1908
01:38:16,688 --> 01:38:18,523
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

1909
01:38:18,557 --> 01:38:21,360
So he needs a lot of protein
with every meal

1910
01:38:21,393 --> 01:38:23,863
and no screen time on the weekdays.

1911
01:38:23,896 --> 01:38:26,733
Weekends, one hour a day
and that's it, all right?

1912
01:38:26,766 --> 01:38:27,834
Bye.

1913
01:38:33,639 --> 01:38:34,640
I love you.

1914
01:38:35,808 --> 01:38:36,909
I love you.

1915
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:06,973
<i>Have you ever thought about the future?</i>

1916
01:39:07,006 --> 01:39:08,808
<i>Have you ever thought about the future?</i>

1917
01:39:09,608 --> 01:39:11,410
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

1918
01:39:11,443 --> 01:39:13,512
<i>Uh, whatever you plan on happening,</i>

1919
01:39:13,545 --> 01:39:15,414
<i>never happens.</i>

1920
01:39:15,447 --> 01:39:18,751
<i>Stuff you would never think of happens.</i>

1921
01:39:18,785 --> 01:39:21,954
<i>So you just have to... You have to come on,</i>

1922
01:39:21,988 --> 01:39:25,323
<i>come on, come on, come on, come on,</i>

1923
01:39:25,357 --> 01:39:29,361
<i>come on, come on, come on, come on.</i>

1924
01:39:31,463 --> 01:39:34,599
<i>Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.</i>

1925
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:38,403
Johnny is a bit strange.

1926
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:43,208
Um, he's really fun.

1927
01:39:45,745 --> 01:39:47,212
He makes me laugh.

1928
01:39:48,815 --> 01:39:50,983
<i>He's really funny when he wrestles.</i>

1929
01:39:53,285 --> 01:39:54,887
<i>He might be my best friend,</i>

1930
01:39:56,521 --> 01:39:58,590
'cause he only has only has two... two...

1931
01:39:58,623 --> 01:40:00,592
He only has two friends,

1932
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,594
but he might be my best friend.

1933
01:40:03,528 --> 01:40:04,663
I don't know.

1934
01:40:09,068 --> 01:40:11,838
<i>Blah, bablah, blah, blah.</i>

1935
01:40:14,372 --> 01:40:17,043
I would say so blah, blah,

1936
01:40:17,076 --> 01:40:19,511
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1937
01:40:21,613 --> 01:40:23,883
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1938
01:40:26,718 --> 01:40:27,754
You ready?

1939
01:40:28,888 --> 01:40:33,793
<i>Hey, Jesse, this is Mozart,</i>

1940
01:40:33,826 --> 01:40:37,596
<i>your intense and overly emotional uncle.</i>

1941
01:40:39,397 --> 01:40:43,836
<i>When I woke up, you were
blaring crazy opera music.</i>

1942
01:40:45,604 --> 01:40:49,374
I was surprised that your mom had left,

1943
01:40:50,475 --> 01:40:52,577
but you didn't seem bothered about it.

1944
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,882
You just pretty much...

1945
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,618
...accepted me.

1946
01:41:00,452 --> 01:41:02,354
<i>I showed you my recorder,</i>

1947
01:41:02,387 --> 01:41:04,623
<i>but you didn't want to be interviewed.</i>

1948
01:41:04,656 --> 01:41:08,094
<i>You recorded the beach,
the sounds of the city.</i>

1949
01:41:08,127 --> 01:41:09,762
<i>I had to go back to New York</i>

1950
01:41:09,796 --> 01:41:11,964
<i>and I asked you to come with me,</i>

1951
01:41:11,998 --> 01:41:14,499
<i>and you just said, "I'd love that."</i>

1952
01:41:14,533 --> 01:41:16,002
And you couldn't sleep,

1953
01:41:16,035 --> 01:41:18,738
and you were just talking a mile a minute,

1954
01:41:18,771 --> 01:41:20,438
and you had so many things to say,

1955
01:41:20,472 --> 01:41:21,741
<i>and what about approaches,</i>

1956
01:41:21,774 --> 01:41:23,608
<i>and how to record...</i>

1957
01:41:23,642 --> 01:41:26,012
<i>And I could never actually stop you,</i>

1958
01:41:26,045 --> 01:41:29,916
<i>and then I kept trying,
and I wish I wouldn't have.</i>

1959
01:41:29,949 --> 01:41:33,019
<i>Now I wanna hear all of your crazy thoughts</i>

1960
01:41:33,052 --> 01:41:34,719
<i>and cool ideas.</i>

1961
01:41:36,055 --> 01:41:39,892
<i>And then we were in bed, you asked...</i>

1962
01:41:39,926 --> 01:41:41,794
Are you gonna remember any of this?

1963
01:41:45,832 --> 01:41:46,899
Maybe.

1964
01:41:50,169 --> 01:41:52,939
And that's, like, our awesome sleepovers.

1965
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:57,143
And you said you won't remember it.

1966
01:41:57,176 --> 01:42:00,746
No, I said, "You won't remember it."

1967
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,014
I'll remember it.

1968
01:42:04,649 --> 01:42:05,852
I won't remember?

1969
01:42:09,789 --> 01:42:12,691
<i>I said, "I hope you do,"</i>

1970
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:17,362
and you got so upset,

1971
01:42:18,998 --> 01:42:20,498
and I said,

1972
01:42:23,468 --> 01:42:26,371
"I'll remind you of everything."

1973
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:00,973
<i>Do you think it's easy
to understand your feelings?</i>

1974
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:04,176
<i>Like, do you have access to...
To what you feel or...</i>

1975
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:06,913
<i>Hmm, the only thing that I do have</i>

1976
01:43:06,946 --> 01:43:08,480
<i>is that I know that I'm safe.</i>

1977
01:43:09,115 --> 01:43:10,850
<i>- That's beautiful.
- Hmm.</i>

1978
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:13,551
<i>Uh, what... What makes you feel safe?</i>

1979
01:43:13,585 --> 01:43:15,201
<i>I'm in a home where people care about me.</i>

1980
01:43:15,221 --> 01:43:16,721
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- And I have friends</i>

1981
01:43:16,756 --> 01:43:18,024
<i>that care about me</i>

1982
01:43:18,057 --> 01:43:20,525
<i>and everything like that.</i>

1983
01:43:21,726 --> 01:43:22,962
<i>Um, I would definitely</i>

1984
01:43:22,995 --> 01:43:24,243
<i>take a lot of what my parents did</i>

1985
01:43:24,263 --> 01:43:28,935
<i>into account of how I parent
my future children.</i>

1986
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:31,904
<i>I would talk to them about what they want,</i>

1987
01:43:31,938 --> 01:43:34,706
<i>and, like, what they feel
would be the best for them,</i>

1988
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:37,542
<i>and make it known, like they could talk,</i>

1989
01:43:37,575 --> 01:43:38,643
<i>but I wouldn't force them.</i>

1990
01:43:38,677 --> 01:43:39,859
<i>I wouldn't be like, "Hey, just so you know</i>

1991
01:43:39,879 --> 01:43:41,713
<i>"we can talk all the time,"</i>

1992
01:43:41,747 --> 01:43:43,481
<i>'cause sometimes parents do that.</i>

1993
01:43:43,515 --> 01:43:44,784
- <i>Mm-hmm.
- And it gets annoying</i>

1994
01:43:44,817 --> 01:43:45,952
<i>and they'll be like...</i>

1995
01:43:45,985 --> 01:43:47,585
<i>It's sort of scary, uh,</i>

1996
01:43:47,619 --> 01:43:49,221
<i>to talk to other people sometimes.</i>

1997
01:43:49,255 --> 01:43:53,092
- <i>Mm-hmm.
- Because, um, uh, personally,</i>

1998
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:55,593
<i>I feel like you never know
what they're gonna say next.</i>

1999
01:43:55,627 --> 01:43:57,263
<i>- So...
- ...right?</i>

2000
01:43:57,296 --> 01:43:59,265
<i>In your... If you had this...</i>

2001
01:43:59,298 --> 01:44:01,100
<i>this superpower, what'd you do?</i>

2002
01:44:01,133 --> 01:44:02,667
<i>What would it be?</i>

2003
01:44:02,701 --> 01:44:04,103
<i>I don't know. I don't think</i>

2004
01:44:04,136 --> 01:44:06,272
<i>I would ever, like, use a superpower.</i>

2005
01:44:06,305 --> 01:44:07,353
<i>I think I would just be me.</i>

2006
01:44:07,373 --> 01:44:09,075
<i>- Like, me is my superpower.
- Yeah.</i>

2007
01:44:09,108 --> 01:44:12,945
<i>And like I use it to help
people and use it in ways that's...</i>

2008
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:15,680
<i>that have never been done before.</i>

2009
01:44:15,714 --> 01:44:16,749
<i>Mmm.</i>

2010
01:44:16,782 --> 01:44:17,850
<i>Yeah.</i>

2011
01:44:17,883 --> 01:44:20,052
<i>That's super.</i>

2012
01:44:20,086 --> 01:44:21,087
<i>What about you, London?</i>

2013
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,189
<i>What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?</i>

2014
01:44:23,222 --> 01:44:26,792
<i>Uh, it would probably be
either the fact that</i>

2015
01:44:26,826 --> 01:44:28,526
<i>I can I have a nasty personality</i>

2016
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,230
<i>that clashes with my siblings
or the fact that</i>

2017
01:44:31,263 --> 01:44:33,232
<i>I might have to have surgery</i>

2018
01:44:33,265 --> 01:44:35,001
<i>when I'm older on this one tooth</i>

2019
01:44:35,034 --> 01:44:36,202
<i>- 'cause it's like...
- Well,</i>

2020
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:39,071
<i>uh, maybe humanity ends,</i>

2021
01:44:39,105 --> 01:44:41,173
<i>just humans cease to exist on this earth.</i>

2022
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:43,209
<i>I mean, uh...</i>

2023
01:44:43,242 --> 01:44:44,243
<i>I don't really know</i>

2024
01:44:44,276 --> 01:44:45,978
<i>if that's a good thing or a bad thing.</i>

2025
01:44:46,012 --> 01:44:47,213
<i>Uh, I mean, if we're...</i>

2026
01:44:47,246 --> 01:44:49,081
<i>Yeah, like I want</i>

2027
01:44:49,115 --> 01:44:52,018
<i>everybody to be kind to each other and</i>

2028
01:44:52,051 --> 01:44:54,020
<i>I don't know, like, any harm</i>

2029
01:44:54,053 --> 01:44:58,824
<i>or any anger towards anybody.
Like, why? Why?</i>

2030
01:44:58,858 --> 01:45:01,293
<i>Wouldn't... Wouldn't you rather be happy</i>

2031
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:03,963
<i>than angry at someone?</i>

2032
01:45:03,996 --> 01:45:05,097
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

2033
01:45:05,131 --> 01:45:06,564
<i>And why do those things</i>

2034
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:08,901
<i>when you can just come together...</i>

2035
01:45:08,934 --> 01:45:11,771
<i>So... What... Describe adults for me.</i>

2036
01:45:11,804 --> 01:45:14,740
<i>Like, what do you think an adult is?</i>

2037
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:19,011
<i>It's... An adult, mm...</i>

2038
01:45:19,045 --> 01:45:21,047
<i>All adults have to do is get money</i>

2039
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,149
<i>and have to pay student loans. Got 'em.</i>

2040
01:45:26,252 --> 01:45:28,586
<i>I think that I get excited</i>

2041
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,803
<i>'cause I know that I can do
something to make the world,</i>

2042
01:45:30,823 --> 01:45:33,025
<i>the world a better place
and I also think that</i>

2043
01:45:33,059 --> 01:45:35,227
<i>it's kinda devastating,
because, like, I'm 14,</i>

2044
01:45:35,261 --> 01:45:37,662
<i>why should I be worried
about the way the world looks,</i>

2045
01:45:37,695 --> 01:45:39,098
<i>or like, I should be able to...</i>

2046
01:45:39,131 --> 01:45:40,299
<i>Do you ever think about</i>

2047
01:45:41,167 --> 01:45:43,235
<i>what happens after you die?</i>

2048
01:45:43,269 --> 01:45:46,272
<i>Even though, like,
the scientific thing to say</i>

2049
01:45:46,305 --> 01:45:48,107
<i>is that we don't think at all,</i>

2050
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:50,076
<i>our bodies decompose</i>

2051
01:45:50,109 --> 01:45:53,145
<i>and, uh, like,
life continues on without us.</i>

2052
01:45:53,179 --> 01:45:54,213
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

2053
01:45:54,246 --> 01:45:59,118
<i>But why would we be made to just die?</i>

2054
01:45:59,151 --> 01:46:01,020
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- There's probably that...</i>

2055
01:46:01,053 --> 01:46:02,354
<i>There's probably not a reason</i>

2056
01:46:02,388 --> 01:46:05,057
<i>but there might be a reason behind it.</i>

2057
01:46:05,091 --> 01:46:07,725
<i>Somehow, I don't know, I'm not sure.</i>

2058
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,396
<i>Kids tend to think freely.</i>

2059
01:46:10,429 --> 01:46:13,799
<i>Adults when they think,
they think in a tight space.</i>

2060
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:16,235
<i>- You get what I'm saying...
- I think...</i>

2061
01:46:16,268 --> 01:46:18,104
<i>it's hard. I think it's probably a cross</i>

2062
01:46:18,137 --> 01:46:21,006
<i>between mind reading and flying.</i>

2063
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,641
<i>Mind reading because if someone's sad,</i>

2064
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:26,145
<i>they usually won't tell you
what's going on.</i>

2065
01:46:26,178 --> 01:46:28,680
<i>And I'm a little bit of a...</i>

2066
01:46:28,713 --> 01:46:31,050
<i>that kind of person that is a little...</i>

2067
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:32,885
<i>Apparently, scientific studies,</i>

2068
01:46:32,918 --> 01:46:35,020
<i>I'm not saying this is
completely true or whatever,</i>

2069
01:46:35,054 --> 01:46:36,989
<i>it's just what I've heard,</i>

2070
01:46:37,022 --> 01:46:38,357
<i>but, uh, your brain</i>

2071
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:40,025
<i>has to knock out some old memories</i>

2072
01:46:40,059 --> 01:46:42,261
<i>to be able to save new ones.</i>

2073
01:46:42,294 --> 01:46:45,431
<i>So I feel like there's
two types of Americans, like,</i>

2074
01:46:45,464 --> 01:46:47,800
<i>people who can constantly
get what they want</i>

2075
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:48,700
<i>and have what they need,</i>

2076
01:46:48,734 --> 01:46:49,748
<i>and then there's the other type</i>

2077
01:46:49,768 --> 01:46:52,204
<i>where they kind of have to struggle</i>

2078
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,808
<i>and work harder
for the things that they need.</i>

2079
01:46:55,841 --> 01:46:57,343
<i>It's not the way we look,</i>

2080
01:46:57,376 --> 01:47:01,447
<i>but it's, like, how we are
on the inside that's...</i>

2081
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:04,250
<i>Just like you can't judge
a book by its cover,</i>

2082
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:07,119
<i>it's the same with humans.</i>

2083
01:47:07,153 --> 01:47:11,090
<i>So I like to look at
the positive side of things.</i>

2084
01:47:11,123 --> 01:47:13,792
<i>Um, I like to think about,</i>

2085
01:47:13,826 --> 01:47:15,995
<i>um, like new inventions that might</i>

2086
01:47:16,028 --> 01:47:18,797
<i>actually help save the world.</i>

2087
01:47:18,831 --> 01:47:23,068
<i>I think about going into space
and discovering a new planet</i>

2088
01:47:23,102 --> 01:47:26,839
<i>and then maybe like building a life there.</i>

2089
01:47:26,872 --> 01:47:29,008
<i>What do you hope that you really remember</i>

2090
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:30,776
<i>about your mom and your dad?</i>

2091
01:47:30,809 --> 01:47:33,379
<i>That they were always there for me,</i>

2092
01:47:33,412 --> 01:47:36,182
<i>that they always love me. They say...</i>

2093
01:47:36,215 --> 01:47:38,284
<i>I tell her</i>

2094
01:47:38,317 --> 01:47:40,753
<i>"good night" every night and...</i>

2095
01:47:40,786 --> 01:47:43,422
<i>I always tell her that I love her,</i>

2096
01:47:43,455 --> 01:47:45,858
<i>just like out of the blue
and she would do the same.</i>

2097
01:47:45,891 --> 01:47:47,359
<i>And I really feel</i>

2098
01:47:47,393 --> 01:47:49,828
<i>that strong connection with her.</i>

2099
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:53,165
<i>If you could have any superpower,</i>

2100
01:47:53,799 --> 01:47:55,167
<i>what would it be?</i>

2101
01:47:55,201 --> 01:47:57,403
<i>The ability to bend space and time.</i>

2102
01:47:59,905 --> 01:48:03,175
<i>If you were what
you believe is a good person</i>

2103
01:48:03,209 --> 01:48:05,477
<i>and you ask whoever you believe in,</i>

2104
01:48:05,511 --> 01:48:07,179
<i>"Hey, can I be reincarnated</i>

2105
01:48:07,213 --> 01:48:08,981
<i>"into, I don't know, like a tiger?"</i>

2106
01:48:09,014 --> 01:48:10,896
<i>And you were a good person
then they would be like,</i>

2107
01:48:10,916 --> 01:48:12,396
<i>"Yeah, you can be a tiger, go ahead."</i>

2108
01:48:15,554 --> 01:48:18,791
<i>Well, I feel like if we die,</i>

2109
01:48:18,824 --> 01:48:21,093
<i>like, we don't really feel anything,</i>

2110
01:48:21,126 --> 01:48:23,095
<i>all like memories are gone and stuff.</i>

2111
01:48:23,128 --> 01:48:26,065
<i>And we're just like,
we'll just see you wait</i>

2112
01:48:26,098 --> 01:48:27,800
<i>becoming a baby.</i>

2113
01:48:28,234 --> 01:48:29,401
<i>And, yeah,</i>

2114
01:48:29,435 --> 01:48:33,005
<i>getting born and then just restarting life.</i>

2115
01:48:33,038 --> 01:48:35,274
<i>Like, I'm not sure 'cause
I've never been dead before.</i>

2116
01:48:36,842 --> 01:48:38,344
<i>Sit down</i>

2117
01:48:38,377 --> 01:48:40,779
<i>and close your eyes,</i>

2118
01:48:40,813 --> 01:48:43,515
<i>and try to find yourself.</i>

2119
01:48:43,549 --> 01:48:46,819
<i>Because I feel like that's
what you really have to do,</i>

2120
01:48:48,087 --> 01:48:49,855
<i>to know what you want.</i>

2121
01:48:49,888 --> 01:48:54,793
<i>Like, find a way that you feel
comfortable finding yourself.</i>

2122
01:48:56,095 --> 01:48:58,030
<i>You know, you gotta find to find.</i>
